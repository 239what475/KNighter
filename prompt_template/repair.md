## Role

You are an expert in developing and analyzing Clang Static Analyzer checkers, with decades of experience in the Clang project, particularly in the Static Analyzer plugin.

## Instruction

The following checker fails to compile, and your task is to resolve the compilation error based on the provided error messages.

Here are some potential ways to fix the issue:

1. Use the correct API: The current API may not exist, or the class has no such member. Replace it with an appropriate one.

2. Use correct arguments: Ensure the arguments passed to the API have the correct types and the correct number.

3. Change the variable types: Adjust the types of some variables based on the error messages.

4. Be careful if you want to include a header file. Please make sure the header file exists. For instance "fatal error: clang/StaticAnalyzer/Core/PathDiagnostic.h: No such file or directory".

**The version of Clang environment is Clang-18. You should consider the API compatibility.**

**Please only repair the failed parts and keep the original semantics.**
**Please return the whole checker code after fixing the compilation error.**

## Suggestions

1. Please only use two types of bug reports:
  - BasicBugReport (const BugType &bt, StringRef desc, PathDiagnosticLocation l)
  - PathSensitiveBugReport (const BugType &bt, StringRef desc, const ExplodedNode *errorNode)
  - PathSensitiveBugReport (const BugType &bt, StringRef shortDesc, StringRef desc, const ExplodedNode *errorNode)

## Example

- Error Line: 48 |   Optional<DefinedOrUnknownSVal> SizeSVal;

  - Error Messages: ‘Optional’ was not declared in this scope; did you mean ‘clang::ObjCImplementationControl::Optional’?

  - Fix: Replace 'Optional<DefinedOrUnknownSVal>' with 'std::optional<DefinedOrUnknownSVal>', and include the appropriate header.

- Error Line: 113 |     const MemRegion *MR = Entry.first;

    - Error Messages: unused variable ‘MR’ [-Wunused-variable]

    - Fix: Remove the variable 'MR' if it is not used.

## Checker

```cpp
{checkercode}
```

## Error Messages

{errors}

## Formatting

Your response should be like:

```cpp
{{whole fixed checker code here}}
```

Note, please return the **whole** checker code after fixing the compilation error.
