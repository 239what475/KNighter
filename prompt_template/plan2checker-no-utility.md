# Instruction

You are proficient in writing Clang Static Analyzer checkers.

Please help me write a CSA checker to detect a specific bug pattern.
You can refer to the `Target Bug Pattern` and `Target Patch` sections to help you understand the bug pattern.
Please make sure your checker can detect the bug shown in the `Buggy Code` section.
Please refer to the `Plan` section to implement the checker.

The version of the Clang environment is Clang-18. You should consider the API compatibility.
The checker you write just needs to be able to detect the bug in C language, no need to consider C++ and Objective-C.

Please complete the template in `Checker Template` section. You should complete the content wrapped in `{{...}}`.

**Please read `Suggestions` section before writing the checker!**
