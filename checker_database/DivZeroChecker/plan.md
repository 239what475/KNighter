Your plan:

1. Identify Division Operations:
   • In checkPreStmt, first check if the binary operator (B) is one of the division or remainder types (BO_Div, BO_Rem, BO_DivAssign, BO_RemAssign).
   • Also, verify that the right-hand side (RHS) type is scalar.

2. Retrieve and Validate the Denominator:
   • Obtain the RHS (denom) SVal.
   • Convert the SVal to a DefinedSVal. If this conversion fails (i.e. it is undefined), then abort this check so that other rules for undefined values can handle it.

3. Use ConstraintManager to Split the State:
   • Call assumeDual on the current state with the DefinedSVal of the denominator. This yields two states:
     – stateNotZero: a state where the denominator is known to be nonzero.
     – stateZero: a state where the denominator may be zero.
   • If stateNotZero is unsatisfiable (i.e. only stateZero is valid), then immediately report a division-by-zero bug by calling reportBug with message "Division by zero" and the stateZero.

4. Incorporate Tainted-Value Analysis:
   • If both stateNotZero and stateZero are possible (i.e. the denominator might be zero but isn’t conclusively zero), check for tainted symbols by calling getTaintedSymbols on the denominator.
   • If any tainted symbols are found, report a taint-specific bug using reportTaintBug with a message such as "Division by a tainted value, possibly zero" and passing the list of tainted symbols.

5. Update the Transition for Safe Division:
   • If the analysis concludes that the denominator is nonzero (i.e. stateNotZero holds), then add a state transition with stateNotZero for subsequent analysis.

Following these concrete, step‐by‐step actions ensures that you catch both definite divisions by zero and those involving tainted (user- or untrusted-sourced) values.
