Your goal is to catch cases where a standard sorting algorithm (or one of a few similar algorithms) is used on a container whose elements are pointers. When such a sort is done, the ordering might be non-deterministic (since pointer comparisons do not necessarily yield a consistent order), even if the code works “by accident.” The following plan shows how the checker works, step by step, and what you need to implement:

------------------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. • Build the AST matcher to catch calls to sorting functions:
   - Create helper matchers that match functions with names like "std::sort", "std::nth_element", "std::partial_sort", "std::partition", "std::stable_sort", and "std::stable_partition".
   - Use a helper (here, the inline function callsName) that creates a matcher by specifying a function declaration with the given name.
   - Combine these using an anyOf matcher to catch any one of these function names.
   - Additionally, ensure that the matched call’s first argument is a container (record type) that contains pointer-like fields. Do this by matching a fieldDecl whose canonical type is a pointer type. This indicates that the container stores pointer-like elements.
   - Finally, bind the matched call expression (the call to a sorting function) with a tag (for example, "sort") for use when reporting.

2. • Traverse the AST and run the matcher:
   - In the checkASTCodeBody callback, search through the body of the Decl using the matcher built in step 1.
   - The matcher should use forEachDescendant to look into any subtree where a call that meets the criteria might appear.
   - Each match will then serve as a candidate for a diagnostic.

3. • Report a diagnostic message:
   - For each match, extract the call expression (using the bound node from the matcher).
   - Get the SourceRange and create a diagnostic location.
   - Compose a clear error message that explains: “Sorting pointer-like elements can result in non-deterministic ordering.”
   - Use the BugReporter, AnalysisDeclContext, and the diagnostic message to emit a report.
   - The report is “basic” in that it highlights the call to the sorting function.

4. • Register the checker:
   - Ensure the checker is registered within clang_registerCheckers (or the newer registration APIs) by calling registerPointerSortingChecker.
   - The registration code also makes sure the checker is only active for C++ (by looking at lang options).

------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Guidance

• Keep the matcher as simple as possible. Rather than writing a complex type traversal, the matcher used here simply looks for a fieldDecl that has a pointer type. This may lead to some false positives, but it is clearly documented in the diagnostic message.

• Use the ASTMatchFinder’s built-in functions such as callee(), hasName(), anyOf(), and traverse() with TK_AsIs to visit the nodes without changing the matching semantics.

• In your checkASTCodeBody method, iterate through every match and call a helper function (here, emitDiagnostics) that gathers the SourceRange, builds the diagnostic message using llvm::raw_string_ostream, and then calls BR.EmitBasicReport with the analysis decl context and proper category.

By following these concrete steps, you are directly matching on problematic sort calls and reporting errors with minimal complexity—yet enough detail to guide users on why sorting pointer-like containers might lead to non-deterministic behavior.

This should provide a clear, step-by-step approach for writing and understanding the PointerSortingChecker in the Clang Static Analyzer.
