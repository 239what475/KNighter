1. Retrieve the return expression for the ReturnStmt.
   • In the checkPreStmt callback, get the return value (RetE) from the ReturnStmt.
   • If RetE is missing or its source range is invalid (e.g., body-farmed functions), then do nothing.

2. Obtain the memory region and check if it is an ElementRegion.
   • Use C.getSVal(RetE) to get the SVal.
   • Convert the SVal to a MemRegion.
   • If the region is not an ElementRegion, skip further analysis because the checker only handles array or pointer arithmetic issues.

3. Extract and analyze the index of the ElementRegion.
   • From the ElementRegion, obtain the index (cast it to DefinedOrUnknownSVal).
   • If the index is a zero constant, consider it safe and return because index zero is always in bounds.
   • Also, if the index is exactly equal to the dynamic element count (the end iterator), then avoid reporting a bug.

4. Obtain the dynamic element count of the underlying array.
   • Use the helper getDynamicElementCount with the current state and the super region.
   • This provides the total number of elements in the original object.

5. Check bounds using state assumptions.
   • Use state->assumeInBoundDual(Idx, ElementCount) to get two possible states: one assuming the index is in bounds and another for out-of-bound.
   • If the out-of-bound state exists (StOutBound) and there is no in-bound state (StInBound is null), then the pointer being returned is out of bounds.

6. Generate and emit the bug report.
   • Create an error node using generateErrorNode with the out-of-bound state.
   • Construct a PathSensitiveBugReport with a clear message (e.g., "Returned pointer value points outside the original object (potential buffer overflow)").
   • Add source-range information from the return expression.
   • If available, include extra notes such as the original object’s name, its array size, and the index where the pointer points. Use additional expressions like DeclRegion details and concrete values for better clarity.
   • Finally, call C.emitReport to output the bug.

By following these concrete steps, you can identify when a returned pointer value falls outside its allocated buffer—indicating a potential buffer overflow—and then report it with sufficient supporting information.
