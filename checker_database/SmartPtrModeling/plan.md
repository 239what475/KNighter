Your plan could be structured as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. State Initialization and Registration  
   • Create a program‐state map (TrackedRegionMap) that records, for each smart pointer’s memory region, the “inner pointer” (SVal) that represents the actual raw pointer held by the smart pointer.  
   • Register the checker so that it is only active for C++ code (via shouldRegisterSmartPtrModeling).

2. Modeling Creation and Retrieval of Underlying Pointer  
   • In evalCall, intercept calls such as std::make_unique or std::make_unique_for_overwrite.  
   • When a smart pointer is constructed:
      – Conjure a heap symbol representing the inner pointer (using getConjuredHeapSymbolVal or retrieveOrConjureInnerPtrVal).  
      – Bind that conjured value to a MemRegion for the smart pointer by storing it in TrackedRegionMap.  
      – Mark the smart pointer as “non-null” by applying a suitable state assumption (using state->assume).

3. Handling Smart Pointer Methods  
   • For methods like reset, release, swap, and get, write dedicated handlers that update the tracked region’s inner pointer value:  
      – In handleReset, update the state with a new inner pointer (ideally warn if resetting with a null value).  
      – In handleRelease, bind the return value to the current inner pointer, then update the region to reflect that it no longer owns a pointer.  
      – In handleSwap (or handleSwapMethod), swap the inner pointer values stored in the tracked state between the involved smart pointers.  
      – In handleGet, similarly retrieve (or conjure) an inner pointer value and bind it to the result of the call.

4. Modeling Move and Assignment Behavior  
   • In cases like move constructor or assignment operations, update the tracked region mapping by transferring the inner pointer:
      – In handleAssignOp and handleMoveCtr, use the updateMovedSmartPointers helper to move the pointer value from one smart pointer’s region to the other (and set the moved-from region to null accordingly).

5. Boolean Conversion and Dereference Modeling  
   • In handleBoolConversion, intercept conversions to bool (operator bool):
      – Retrieve the inner pointer from the TrackedRegionMap and test its “null” status (using isNull or isNonNull).  
      – Bind the operator’s result accordingly so that subsequent dereferences (or comparisons) are modeled properly.  
   • In evalCall, also intercept comparison operations or ostream operator calls if needed, so that the inner pointer’s state is considered.

6. Dead Symbol and Region Cleanup  
   • In checkDeadSymbols, loop over the TrackedRegionMap to remove any entries whose MemRegions are “dead” (not live anymore).
   • Similarly, in checkRegionChanges, make sure that when a region is invalidated the corresponding entry (or its subregions) is removed from the state map.

7. Debug and State Printing  
   • Implement printState to dump the current smart pointer state map (e.g., listing each smart pointer’s region and whether its inner pointer is null or non-null) for debugging in the analyzer. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
This plan is broken down into concrete, sequential steps so that you can follow each phase step‐by‐step as you model and instrument the smart pointer behaviors. Each phase deals with a specific aspect—creation, method handling, move/assignment, dead symbol cleanup, and state printing—which together ensure that the smart pointer’s inner pointer is tracked accurately and that state changes (including potential null dereference modeling) are properly reported.
