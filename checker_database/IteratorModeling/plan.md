Your plan should explain what the checker does and how it does so. For the IteratorModeling checker, you can follow these concrete steps:

-------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Purpose and Abstraction
   • The checker models STL iterators by tracking an abstract “iterator position” (an IteratorPosition object) that represents the symbolic location (state) within a container.
   • Iterator positions are stored using program state maps keyed either by a symbol (for rvalue or temporary iterators) or by a memory region (when an iterator is a named variable or lvalue).

2. Hook Registration
   • The checker registers callbacks for different events:
     - checkPostCall: to handle function calls (including overloaded operators and functions like std::advance, std::prev, std::next) returning iterator objects.
     - checkPostStmt (UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator, MaterializeTemporaryExpr): to model operator-based iterator updates and transfers.
     - checkBind: to record pointer aliasing when an iterator’s value is copied or bound from one location to another.
     - checkLiveSymbols and checkDeadSymbols: to keep the iterator-related symbols alive during analysis and to clean up state when they become dead.

3. Modeling Iterator Creation and Copies in checkPostCall
   • On post-call of a function, the checker first checks if the call is an overloaded operator.
     - For overloaded operators, it dispatches to handleOverloadedOperator to update the iterator position.
   • It then looks for “advance-like” functions (std::advance, std::prev, std::next) using the AdvanceLikeFunctions map.
     - If matched, the corresponding handler (handleAdvance, handlePrev, or handleNext) is called.
   • For constructors (copy or move), the checker checks if the passed iterator already has a recorded position.
     - If so, it assigns that position to the return value. For move constructors, it also removes the original position.

4. Updating Iterator Positions via Operator Overloads
   • The handleOverloadedOperator function distinguishes between:
     - Simple comparisons: which use handleComparison to link the positions of two iterators via their symbolic offsets.
     - Increments/decrements: which use handleIncrement and handleDecrement. These functions update the iterator’s position by adding or subtracting a concrete constant (usually 1).
     - More complicated arithmetic (e.g. random increment/decrement): handled by handleRandomIncrOrDecr.
   • For pointer arithmetic (when an iterator is implemented as a pointer), handlePtrIncrOrDecr explicitly computes a new lvalue from the old position and an offset.

5. Propagating and Binding State with checkBind
   • When a value is bound to a new memory region (for example, during assignment), checkBind updates the program state so that the new location is tied to the same iterator position as the original.
   • This may also remove iterator position information if the left-hand side had a previous mapping.

6. Handling Temporary Propagation via checkPostStmt (MaterializeTemporaryExpr)
   • When a temporary iterator is created from an existing one (via a MaterializeTemporaryExpr), the checker transfers the iterator position from the original to the temporary.

7. Constraint Propagation in Iterator Comparisons
   • In a comparison (e.g. using == or !=), handleComparison retrieves the iterator positions and, if one is missing, conjures a fresh symbol and then sets up a constraint.
   • processComparison binds the two iterator offset symbols with an assumption based on whether they should be equal (or not), allowing the analyzer to later reason about comparisons.

8. Cleanup and Maintenance
   • checkLiveSymbols ensures that all symbols used in iterator positions remain live as long as needed.
   • checkDeadSymbols cleans up mappings for memory regions and symbols that are no longer live.

9. Debugging Information
   • The printState method provides a human-readable dump of the current iterator position mappings (from symbols or regions to their container and offset) for debugging purposes.

-------------------------------------------------
Following this plan, you can implement the checker in a straightforward way. Each step ties a particular event (call, bind, temporary creation, dead-symbol cleanup) to an update or propagation of the abstract iterator position maintained in program state, thereby modeling STL iterator arithmetic and comparisons correctly.
