Below is a concrete plan outlining how the UndefinedAssignmentChecker detects assignments of undefined values:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Intercept Every Binding Event
   • Register a callback for the "bind" event by specializing the Checker for check::Bind.
   • Every time a value is bound to a memory location (i.e. assignment), the checkBind callback is invoked.

2. Check If the Value Is Undefined
   • In checkBind, inspect the value being assigned by calling val.isUndef().
   • If the value is not undefined, simply return without further processing.

3. Ignore Special Cases (e.g., swap Function)
   • Retrieve the current function from the stack frame.
   • If the function name is "swap", then do not report an error.
   • This allows common swap-idioms that may involve partially uninitialized values to pass without a bug report.

4. Generate an Error Node
   • Call C.generateErrorNode() to generate an ExplodedNode for reporting.
   • If no node is produced, then do not proceed with generating a report.

5. Prepare the Diagnostic Message
   • Create a diagnostic message that explains the problem: that an uninitialized (undefined) value is being assigned.
   • Walk through the StoreE (the binding’s store expression) using a while loop:
     - For a UnaryOperator, report that the subexpression is an uninitialized value.
     - For a BinaryOperator with a compound assignment, check if the left-hand side is undefined and report accordingly.
     - For a DeclStmt initializing a variable, pick the initializer.
     - For implicit C++ constructors, determine the field being assigned.
   • If none of these specific cases match, use a default message from the BugType description.

6. Report the Bug
   • Create a PathSensitiveBugReport with the prepared message and the error node.
   • Optionally add the source range for the key subexpression in the report to make the bug easier to understand.
   • Finally, emit the bug report by calling C.emitReport().

------------------------------------------------------------
This step‐by‐step plan is simple yet concrete. It provides strong guidance on where and how the checker intercepts assignments, what conditions are verified, how special exemptions (like swap) are handled, how diagnostic messages are built, and finally how the checker reports the bug to the user.
