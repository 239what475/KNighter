Your plan for the UndefinedNewArraySizeChecker can be summarized in a few concrete steps. Each step is specific and straightforward:

```
1. Check if the call is a new[] allocation:
   • In the checkPreCall callback, first determine if the CallEvent is a CXXAllocatorCall.
   • Verify that the allocation is for an array by calling isArray().

2. Retrieve the array size:
   • Obtain the array size expression (SizeEx) using getArraySizeExpr().
   • Get the corresponding SVal (SizeVal) with getArraySizeVal().

3. Detect an undefined array size:
   • Check if SizeVal is undefined by calling isUndef().
   • If the size is undefined, it means the element count is a garbage value.

4. Report the bug:
   • In the helper function HandleUndefinedArrayElementCount(), generate an error node.
   • Create a bug report with a message indicating that the element count in new[] is a garbage value.
   • Mark the undefined SVal as interesting, add the source range from the array size expression, and track the expression’s value.
   • Finally, emit the bug report.
```

This concrete plan shows each step you need to implement or understand in order to detect undefined new[] array sizes.
