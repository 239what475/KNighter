Your goal is to walk through the AST of a function’s body, look at every cast expression, and then decide if it represents a risky cast from a non-struct type to a struct type or a widening cast when both types are records. Here’s a simple, step‐by‐step plan:

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Traverse the AST of the Function Body

• In your checker’s checkASTCodeBody callback, instantiate an AST visitor (your CastToStructVisitor) and call its TraverseDecl() method on the current declaration.  
  – This lets you examine every node (in particular, CastExpr nodes) in the function body.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Visit Each Cast Expression

• In your visitor’s VisitCastExpr method, get the inner expression (the source of the cast) and the cast expression’s resulting type.  
  – For both types, compute their canonical types using your ASTContext.
  – Convert both the source type and destination type to PointerType.  
   • If either conversion fails, then the cast isn’t between pointers—skip it.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Filter Allowed Cases

• Get the pointee types of both pointer types.  
  – If the destination’s pointee type is not a structure or class, ignore the cast.  
  – Allow casts from void* (i.e. if the original’s pointee type is void, skip the check).
  – If you find that the original’s pointee type is not a record (i.e. not a structure/class) while the destination’s is, then report an error saying “Cast from non-struct type to struct type.”

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4. Detect and Report Widening Casts

• In cases where both the original and the destination types are records, you have a struct-to-struct cast.  
  – Only process cases where the cast comes from an address-of operator (your code checks for a UnaryOperator with UO_AddrOf) because that suggests you’re taking the address of a variable.  
  – Skip the check if the underlying declaration is a reference type.  
  – If the type’s definitions are complete, retrieve the size (width) information for both the original and the destination struct types using the ASTContext’s type info.  
  – If the destination type has a wider width than the original, this is a widening cast. Emit a warning “Widening cast to struct type.”

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5. Emit a Report

• Use the BugReporter’s EmitBasicReport API to generate and report your warning.  
  – Provide the current declaration (from AnalysisDeclContext), your checker pointer, an appropriate descriptive message, a diagnostic category (for instance, categories::LogicError), and the problematic source range.  
  – This simple report ensures that the user is informed of the potential risk.

------------------------------------------------------------
That is the complete, concrete plan. Following these steps, your checker will flag the dangerous cast patterns described in CWE-588 by:

1. Traversing the AST.
2. Focusing on pointer casts.
3. Skipping valid cases (like casts from void*).
4. Reporting casts that either change a non-struct pointer to a struct pointer or widen the struct data layout.

This plan is both simple and concrete, so you can directly implement a correct and efficient checker.
