Your job is to detect problematic writes into autoreleased out parameters. Here’s a simple, concrete plan with fewer steps that still explains everything you need to know:

-----------------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Identify the Target Parameter(s)
   • Define an AST matcher to find parameters (ParmVarDecl) whose type points to an object with autoreleasing lifetime.  
   • For example, match parameters of type “pointer to (...) with ObjC autoreleasing qualifier”.  
   • Bind these parameters (e.g., using bind("parambind")) so you can refer to them later.

2. Detect Problematic Writes or Captures into the Parameter
   • Write an AST matcher to capture any write operation where the parameter is dereferenced and assigned to, for example:
         – A binary operator with the left-hand side being a unary operator that dereferences the parameter.
   • Also match code where the parameter is captured in a block (inside a call or message expression) if a direct write is not available.  
   • Bind these writes or capture expressions (e.g., "problematicwrite" for the write and "capturedbind" for the capture).

3. Recognize Contexts Involving Autorelease Pool Usage
   • Write an AST matcher that detects an autorelease pool statement (autoreleasePoolStmt).  
   • This is important because the suspicious write might occur inside a block passed to a function or inside an autorelease pool that could lead to early deallocation.
   • Bind the autorelease pool context (e.g., "isautoreleasepoolbind") so you can use it in your diagnostic message.

4. Compose a Matcher for Functions or Methods Using the Parameter
   • Combine the parameter and the problematic write matchers so that the overall matcher finds functions/methods (or even blocks) that 
     – have the candidate autoreleasing parameter AND 
     – contain a suspicious write or capture inside a block or autorelease pool.
   • Use the “decl” matcher with “anyOf” to handle functions, ObjC methods, or block declarations.
   • Optionally add additional matcher constraints (for example, checking that the function name or selector is one known to create an autorelease pool context).

5. Emit a Diagnostic When a Match is Found
   • In your checkASTCodeBody callback, iterate over the matches from your AST matcher.
   • For each match, verify that the parameter has an autoreleasing type.
   • Construct a detailed bug report message:
         – Use a concise message like “Write to autoreleasing out parameter inside autorelease pool” 
         – Mention whether it is a direct write or a capture (if applicable).
   • Obtain the source location and range from the bound nodes (from the write or capture matcher) and use BugReporter to emit the diagnostic.

6. Register Your Checker
   • Write a registration function (clang_registerCheckers or registerAutoreleaseWriteChecker) that adds your checker to the manager.
   • Make sure your checker is invoked on function declarations (or ObjC methods) containing bodies so that checkASTCodeBody gets called.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Using these concrete steps:
– Step 1 tells you how to target the parameter.
– Step 2 shows you what kind of AST nodes to match for the problematic operations.
– Step 3 ensures that your matcher is aware of the autorelease pool context.
– Step 4 combines the components to restrict the scope to valid candidates.
– Step 5 explains how to report the error.
– Step 6 wraps up by showing how to integrate your checker with the analyzer.

By following this plan you’ll have a simple, concrete, and correct checker that warns about writes (or captures) to autoreleasing out parameters that can lead to crashes.
