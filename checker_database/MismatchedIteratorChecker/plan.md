Your plan here

1. Setup and Registration  
   • Define and register the checker class (MismatchedIteratorChecker) derived from Checker with callbacks for pre-call events and pre-statement binary operators.  
   • Create a BugType instance (MismatchedBugType) with an appropriate message (e.g., “Iterator(s) mismatched”) to report misuse of iterators.  

2. Check Function Calls (checkPreCall)  
   • In the checkPreCall method, first get the invoked function’s declaration.  
   • For overloaded operator calls (comparison operators), inspect whether the arguments are of iterator types.  
   • Depending on the call type (instance call vs. plain call), retrieve the iterators:
  – For instance calls, extract the ‘this’ pointer (the container) and the argument iterator.
  – For non-instance calls with two iterator arguments, check both.
   • Also handle container member functions like erase, insert, emplace where the container is accessed via the “this” pointer and the iterators (or iterator pairs) are passed as arguments.
   • For a container constructor that takes an iterator pair (e.g. parameters named “first” and “last”), ensure that both iterators belong to the same container.
   • In each case, call a helper (verifyMatch) to compare the container(s) based on the passed iterator values.

3. Check Binary Operator Comparisons (checkPreStmt)  
   • When a binary operator is encountered that performs a comparison, verify if both sides are iterators.  
   • Retrieve both operands’ SVal using the current state and call verifyMatch to check if they belong to the same container.  

4. Verify Matching Iterators  
   • Implement verifyMatch with two overloads:
  – One version expects an iterator SVal and a container region. It does the following:
    ∘ Convert the container region to its most derived region.
    ∘ Get the iterator’s associated position (using a helper like getIteratorPosition) and extract the container it points into.
    ∘ Compare the container from the iterator to the container region from the call; if they differ then there is a mismatch.  
  – The other version accepts two iterator SVal parameters, obtains each iterator’s position, retrieves the container with which each is associated, then compares the two containers.
   • Skip reporting mismatches for symbolic or conjured containers (if the container’s symbolic base is a conjured symbol) to avoid false positives.

5. Bug Reporting  
   • In verifyMatch, if a mismatch is detected (i.e. the two containers differ), generate a nonfatal error node using the CheckerContext.  
   • Call reportBug (with overloaded variants) to prepare a PathSensitiveBugReport, marking the relevant iterator SVal and container region as “interesting” to provide diagnostics.

6. Conclusion  
   • After performing the necessary state/verifications in the callbacks (for both call and statement), do not forget to add transitions (using C.addTransition(...)) so that the analyzer can propagate the updated state.
   • This ensures that during analysis, each potential iterator mismatch is caught and reported properly, helping diagnose improper use of iterators across containers.

By following these concrete steps, you will create a simple but effective checker that detects when iterators from one container are used with operations expecting iterators from another container.
