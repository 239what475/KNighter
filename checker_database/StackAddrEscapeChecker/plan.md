Below is a concrete plan for detecting stack address escapes with minimal, clear steps. In this case the goal is to catch cases where a stack‐allocated address might “escape” into a global or heap location (or be returned), which is a violation of CERT DCL30-C. We do so by examining function calls, return statements, and even the end of a function where global bindings are checked.

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Detect Escaping Through Function Calls
   • In the checkPreCall callback, first check if the called function is one of the async dispatch functions (for example, “dispatch_after” or “dispatch_async”).
   • If so, iterate over the call’s arguments.
   • When an argument is a block—specifically a BlockDataRegion—inspect its captured variables.
   • Call a helper (checkAsyncExecutedBlockCaptures) to look for captured stack regions. Use getCapturedStackRegions to retrieve all variables captured from a stack frame.
   • For each such captured region (except inner blocks that are copied), generate a bug report that an address from the stack is captured by an asynchronously executed block.

2. Detect Escaping Through Return Statements
   • In the checkPreStmt callback (registered for ReturnStmt), check for return values.
   • Get the return expression and its SVal. If the SVal represents memory (a MemRegion)…
   • If that region comes from the current stack frame (and is not from safe IPv4 copies like temporary record objects), then call EmitStackError.
   • When handling blocks returned from functions, call checkReturnedBlockCaptures and report if a block is returning a stack-allocated capture.

3. Check Global (or Heap) Bindings at Function End
   • In the checkEndFunction callback, iterate over all the stored bindings in the program state (bindings to globals).
   • For each binding, if the value refers to a stack region (using helper functions such as isNotInCurrentFrame to check the frame) then record that as a potential problem.
   • For every such found binding, generate a report stating that a global (or heap) variable is holding a stack address.

4. Generate Clear Error Messages
   • Use the helper genName to build a descriptive message that includes details such as whether the address came from a local variable, an alloca() call, a block, or a temporary object.
   • In every case where an error node is generated (using generateNonFatalErrorNode), attach the proper source range (via getSourceRange) and use a unique BugType (e.g., BT_returnstack, BT_stackleak) with a descriptive text.

5. Maintain Minimal State and Flags
   • Keep a flag array (ChecksEnabled) to enable specific checking modes (async escaping vs. returned block escapes).
   • Reuse helper functions (like getCapturedStackRegions and isNotInCurrentFrame) to avoid duplicating logic.

------------------------------------------------------------
With this plan, you have a clear step-by-step approach:
– Check asynchronous block calls and inspect captured stack addresses.
– In return statements, verify that you are not returning a local (stack) region.
– At the function end, look for any globals holding stack addresses.
– Finally, create detailed diagnostic messages that pinpoint the source of the escaping stack address.

Following these concrete steps will help you write a correct and straightforward checker for detecting stack address escapes.
