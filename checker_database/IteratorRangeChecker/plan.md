Your checker works by intercepting calls and statements that involve iterator operations and then verifying whether the iterator is used out-of-range. Here’s a simple, step‐by‐step plan with concrete details:

------------------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Detect Iterator Operations via Callbacks:
   • In checkPreCall:
     – When a function call is intercepted, first determine if the callee is an overloaded operator.
     – If it is an increment (operator++) or decrement (operator––), extract the iterator value—either from the instance (for instance calls) or from the argument.
     – For random increment/decrement operators (like iterator + integer), check if the second argument is an integral value.
     – For dereference (operator*) calls, extract the iterator value.
     – Also, check for calls to known “advance functions” such as std::advance, std::prev, and std::next (via a lookup mapping) and then call the corresponding verification function.
     
2. Detect Iterator Operations via Statement Checks:
   • In checkPreStmt:
     – For UnaryOperator nodes:
         ◦ If the operator is a dereference, increment, or decrement operator, extract the sub-expression (the iterator) and verify it.
     – For BinaryOperator nodes:
         ◦ If the operator is a dereference (overloaded operator) or a random increment/decrement (when one side is an integral type), extract the left-hand side (the iterator) and right-hand side value and verify the operation.
     – For ArraySubscriptExpr and non-implicit MemberExpr (arrow access), treat the access as a dereference on the iterator or pointer and verify it.

3. Verify the Iterator’s Position:
   • In verifyDereference:
     – Retrieve the iterator’s current position (using helper getIteratorPosition) from the program state.
     – Check (via helper isPastTheEnd) whether the iterator position equals the “past-the-end” position.
     – If it is, generate an error node and report a bug with a clear message (e.g. “Past-the-end iterator dereferenced.”).

4. Verify Index Operations (Increment/Decrement and Random Changes):
   • In verifyIncrement and verifyDecrement:
     – Normalize the operation to a random increment/decrement check by passing a concrete offset (e.g. +1 or –1).
   • In verifyRandomIncrOrDecr:
     – Use the operator kind and integer offset (after ensuring the offset isn’t zero) to compute the iterator’s new position (using a helper like advancePosition).
     – Then, check if the new position is:
         ◦ Ahead of the container’s beginning (using isAheadOfRange) or
         ◦ Beyond the container’s valid end (using isBehindPastTheEnd).
     – If either condition holds, then generate an error node and report a bug with the appropriate message.

5. Report the Bug:
   • When any verification function finds an out-of-range condition (whether by dereferencing a past-the-end iterator or by advancing the iterator out-of-range), call reportBug.
   • reportBug creates a PathSensitiveBugReport using the provided bug type “Iterator out of range” and attaches interesting symbols (like the iterator and its container) to help localize the error.
   • Finally, emit the bug report to surface the problem to the user.

------------------------------------------------------------
Each step is implemented using the corresponding checker callbacks (checkPreCall for function calls, checkPreStmt for various statements) and helper verification routines that compare the iterator’s symbolic position with valid container bounds. This design lets you catch misuse such as dereferencing a past-the-end iterator or performing illegal increments/decrements in a concise, systematic way.

By following these concrete steps, you can write and understand a checker that detects STL iterator out-of-range errors.
