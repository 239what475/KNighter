Your goal is to make sure that when a function call returns a pointer and its declaration is annotated with returns_nonnull, the analyzer “trusts” that the returned pointer is non-null. Here’s a step‐by‐step, concrete plan with as few steps as possible:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Identify the Target Calls:
   • In the checkPostCall callback, examine every call.
   • Only consider calls where the expected return type is a pointer (using isAnyPointerType).
   • Retrieve the call’s declaration (using Call.getDecl()).
   • Check whether the function declaration is annotated with the returns_nonnull attribute.  
     (This is done in the helper function isNonNullPtr.)

2. Set the Non-Null Assumption:
   • If the call passes the above check (i.e. it returns a pointer and has the attribute), try to extract the return value as a location using Call.getReturnValue().getAs<Loc>().
   • Use the program’s state method assume: call State = State->assume(*L, true) on that location.  
     This operation tells the analyzer that the pointer must be non-null.

3. Transition the Updated State:
   • After updating the program state with the non-null assumption, add this new state as the next transition with C.addTransition(State).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Each step is concrete:
– Step 1 ensures only calls that are expected to never return null are processed.
– Step 2 uses the program state’s assume mechanism to “mark” the return value as non-null.
– Step 3 hands control back to the analyzer with the updated state.

Following this plan, you can write a checker that “trusts” the non-null attribute and subsequently avoids false-positive warnings on pointer dereferences stemming from calls that are guaranteed to return non-null pointers.
