## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is modeling STL “find‐like” algorithms by manufacturing (i.e. “conjuring”) a new symbolic iterator as a result of the call without fully capturing the search semantics. In this pattern the checker takes the range’s begin and end iterators, creates a new unconstrained iterator symbol, and then “assumes” (via ad hoc comparisons) that its position lies between the two. This abstraction does not precisely represent the real behavior of these algorithms—namely, the distinction between a successful search (an iterator within the range) and a failed one (typically returning the end iterator)—and may lead to modeling inaccuracies that propagate through similar algorithm calls elsewhere.
