Your goal is to simulate the behavior of STL “find” functions by intercepting calls to these functions and then modeling the returned iterator’s properties. Here’s a simple, step‐by‐step plan:

------------------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Identify and Register Target Functions
   • Create a mapping (using CallDescriptionMap) that associates known STL “find” algorithms (such as std::find, std::find_if, std::find_first_of, std::find_end, std::lower_bound, std::upper_bound, std::search, and std::search_n) with a callback handler.
   • In the callbacks map, note the specific overloads (e.g. with 3, 4, 5, or 6 parameters).

2. Intercept Calls with evalCall
   • In the evalCall method, cast the origin expression to a CallExpr.
   • Lookup the call in the Callbacks map.
   • If a matching function is found, call the corresponding handler (in our case, evalFind).

3. Process “find”-Type Calls in evalFind
   • Determine which argument represents the beginning of the search range:
       – If the first argument is an iterator (i.e. not an execution policy), it is used.
       – Otherwise, if the first parameter is an execution policy, then the second argument represents the beginning.
   • Call a helper function (Find) with the correct parameter index to process the call.

4. Model the Iterator Result in Find
   • Conjure a symbolic value (using conjureSymbolVal) for the algorithm’s return value (the iterator result).
   • Retrieve the search range beginning iterator value (from the function parameter).
   • Bind this new symbolic iterator to the call expression in the program state.

5. Impose Iterator Ordering Constraints
   • Extract the “position” of the beginning iterator using getIteratorPosition.
   • Use createIteratorPosition to “attach” an iterator position (i.e. container and offset) to the conjected result.
   • Set up symbolic constraints such that the found iterator is not located “before” the beginning of the range by:
       – Comparing offsets (using BO_GE and BO_LT operators) between the new iterator’s offset and the original range’s offset.
       – Make sure that in a successful search, the new iterator’s offset is not less than the beginning and (if available) not beyond the end iterator.
   • Use the state’s assumption functions to add these constraints to the program state.

6. Handle Alternative Outcome for Aggressive Modeling
   • Check if AggressiveStdFindModeling is turned on.
   • If yes, also create an alternative state transition by binding the call expression to the original end iterator.
   • This models the behavior where std::find could "fail" and simply return the end iterator.

7. Add New Program State Transitions
   • After modeling the result, add the modified state(s) to the analysis using C.addTransition.
   • This allows the analyzer to follow both the “found” and “not found” paths.

------------------------------------------------------------
By following these concrete steps, you are intercepting the relevant STL algorithms, simulating our iterator behavior (via symbolic values and constraints), and propagating the proper state transitions through the analyzer. This simple plan should help you set up the checker so that it can model STL algorithms’ behavior accordingly.
