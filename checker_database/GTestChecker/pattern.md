## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is the loss or failure to propagate essential state (in this case, the boolean "success_" flag) when constructors (especially copy and bool constructors) are not inlined. This pattern appears when an un-inlined API (like gtest’s AssertionResult API) copies a key value through its constructors but that value isn’t properly tracked by the analyzer—leading to an imprecise or incorrect simulation of the object’s state. In other words, if critical data is transferred indirectly (via constructors or similar functions) without explicit propagation, later code may misinterpret the object’s state (e.g., treating a successful assertion as false), which in turn can cause subsequent false positives or misdiagnoses.
