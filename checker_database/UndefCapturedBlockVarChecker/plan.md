Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Trigger on Block Expressions:
   • This checker is registered for the check::PostStmt callback with a BlockExpr.
   • When a block expression is evaluated, the checker’s checkPostStmt callback is invoked.

2. Ignore Blocks Without Captures:
   • Quickly return if the block does not capture any variables by using BE->getBlockDecl()->hasCaptures().

3. Obtain the Block Region:
   • Get the associated block memory region (BlockDataRegion) via the SVal for the BlockExpr.
   • This region holds information about the captured variables.

4. Iterate Over Captured Variables:
   • For each captured variable in the block (obtained from R->referenced_vars()):
     – Retrieve the corresponding VarRegion from the captured variable.
     – Get the variable’s declaration from the VarRegion.

5. Filter Out Ineligible Variables:
   • Skip variables that either:
     – Have the BlocksAttr attribute (indicating special block semantics), or
     – Do not have local storage (they are not the local variables of interest).
     
6. Check Initialization Status:
   • For each remaining variable, identify its original region in the enclosing (non-block) context.
   • Retrieve the SVal from the ProgramState for the original region.
   • Check if the SVal is an UndefinedVal. If it is, then the variable is uninitialized.

7. Generate a Bug Report:
   • If an uninitialized variable is found:
     – Use C.generateErrorNode() to create an error node.
     – Construct a bug report message (e.g., "Variable 'x' is uninitialized when captured by block").
     – Find the corresponding DeclRefExpr within the block body (using the helper FindBlockDeclRefExpr) to get the source range for highlighting.
     – Optionally, attach tracking information for the undefined value to the bug report.
     – Disable path pruning on the report to ensure complete error coverage.
     
8. Emit the Report:
   • Finally, use C.emitReport() to report the potential issue to the Static Analyzer.

------------------------------------------------------------
In summary, the checker works by intercepting block expressions, iterating through the captured variables, and, for each variable stored in the block, checking if its value is undefined in the original context. When an uninitialized captured variable is detected, an error node is generated and a bug report is emitted with detailed source location information.

This step-by-step plan should guide you to implement or understand the checker in a concrete and straightforward manner.
