Below is one simple, concrete plan that explains how the CStringChecker works. In our plan we describe the checker’s responsibilities step by step so you can follow and re‐implement it if needed.

--------------------------------------------------
Plan
--------------------------------------------------
1. Initialization and State Tracking  
   • The checker defines a program state map (using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) to keep track of the “C string length” for memory regions.  
   • Several BugTypes are created (e.g. for null arguments, out‐of-bounds accesses, buffer overlaps, etc.) to be issued when a problem is found.  

2. Mapping C Library Function Calls to Callbacks  
   • A CallDescriptionMap is built: each entry associates a function signature (for example, memcpy, strcpy, strlcpy, strcat, etc.) with a dedicated callback (e.g. evalMemcpy, evalStrcpyCommon).  
   • Additionally, a helper (identifyCall) is used in evalCall to select the correct callback based on the function name and expected parameters.  

3. Argument Checking and Precondition Validation  
   • For each intercepted call the callback first checks that pointer arguments are not NULL (using the checkNonNull helper).  
   • The checker extracts the actual destination and source pointer values from the call event.  
   • Before doing any arithmetic on buffer sizes, it confirms that the argument types are proper (integral or pointer types).  

4. Memory and Buffer Access Analysis  
   • The checker uses helper functions such as CheckBufferAccess and CheckLocation to verify that the memory region (destination/source) is large enough to support the intended operation.  
   • For functions that copy or concatenate strings (for example, memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strlcat), it computes the amount of data that will be accessed or overwritten.  
   • When a bound is supplied (for bounded functions such as strncpy or strnlen) the checker uses assumeZero and other arithmetic helpers to ensure the size does not exceed the actual available buffer length.

5. Overlap and Invalidation Checks  
   • When dealing with copy functions, the checker calls CheckOverlap to verify that the destination and source do not overlap in an invalid way.  
   • Once the operation is modeled, the checker “invalidates” the destination region (using functions such as invalidateDestinationBufferBySize) to model the effect that the old contents are overwritten.
   • For the source, a similar invalidation occurs (with invalidateSourceBuffer) to simulate that its contents are “read” or have been consumed.

6. State Updates and Binding the Return Value  
   • After processing each call, the checker updates the program state—binding new “C string length” values using setCStringLength if the new size (or symbolically computed length) is known.
   • The return value is set according to the C standard: for example, memcpy returns the destination buffer, strlcpy returns the source length, and stpcpy returns a pointer to the byte following the copied region.
   • If the precise value cannot be computed, a new symbolic value is “conjured” using the SValBuilder.

7. Handling Other Events (DeclStmt, Live/Dead Symbols, Region Changes)  
   • In the checkPreStmt callback, the checker records the lengths of arrays that are initialized with string literals (for later use when processing string functions).  
   • The checkRegionChanges, checkLiveSymbols, and checkDeadSymbols callbacks ensure that the “CStringLength” map is kept up to date as regions are invalidated or go out of scope.

8. Overall Flow in evalCall  
   • The evalCall method identifies if the call is a string function (by matching the call against the CallDescriptionMap).  
   • It then dispatches the call to the specific evaluation function, which checks the argument values, verifies buffer bounds and overlaps, updates the state appropriately, and finally emits a bug report if any check fails.

--------------------------------------------------

By following these steps the checker is able to model a variety of C string function calls (like memcpy, strcpy, memset, sprintf etc.) in a precise manner. Each step is concrete—a new state transition is added when a pointer is verified or a bug is detected. You can use this plan as a simple guide to write a correct checker that issues warnings (or bugs) when a C string function is misused.
