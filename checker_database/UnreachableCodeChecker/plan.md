Below is one way to think about the detection plan for the UnreachableCodeChecker. The idea is to use a two‐phase approach: first, mark which CFG blocks got exercised (i.e. reached during analysis) by walking the exploded graph, and then walk the whole CFG to report blocks that were never reached. Here’s a concrete step‐by-step plan:

-------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

Step 1. Gather Reached Blocks during EndAnalysis  
 • When checkEndAnalysis is called, initialize two sets: one (“reachable”) to hold the IDs of blocks where an exploded node was seen and another (“visited”) for our recursive search.  
 • Iterate over the nodes in the exploded graph. For each node, get its ProgramPoint and location context. If the point represents an entrance to a CFG block (using BlockEntrance), add that block’s ID to the reachable set.  
 • Also save the CFG (from the analysis DeclContext) and the ParentMap (for later use) from the first top‐frame node encountered.

Step 2. Process Each CFG Block  
 • With the CFG in hand, loop over every block.  
 • Skip any block that was already marked as reached (its block ID is in the reachable set).  
 • Skip blocks that are “empty” (as determined by isEmptyCFGBlock) since these are artificial or helper blocks.

Step 3. Check and Adjust for Unreachable Entry Points  
 • For each block not already known as reached, call the helper FindUnreachableEntryPoints passing the current block, the reachable set, and the visited set. This helper recursively walks the predecessors to see if an unreachable block could be “rescued” by a reachable predecessor.  
 • After this, if the block’s ID is now in the reachable set, skip it from reporting.

Step 4. Filter Out False Positives  
 • Use additional checks (with isInvalidPath) to ignore paths that look “suspicious” but are not really bugs (for example, conditions involving macros, static locals, or certain builtins).  
 • Also ignore blocks with a “default” label (common in switches) or blocks that have a call to __builtin_unreachable (or similar markers indicating intentional dead code).

Step 5. Identify a Statement to Report  
 • For a CFG block that is confirmed unreachable, use getUnreachableStmt to pick a concrete statement from the block (or, if not available, the terminator stmt).  
 • Calculate the source range and location (and do further filtering, such as skipping system headers) so the reported warning points to the right code.

Step 6. Report the Unreachable Code  
 • Finally, use the BugReporter (with a call to EmitBasicReport) to issue a warning. The message will be “Unreachable code,” and the category is set as “UnusedCode.”  
 • The report includes the source location and range of the unreachable statement so users can see exactly which code was never executed.

-------------------------------------------------

This plan follows a “first mark then report” approach: 

1. Mark reachable block IDs via the exploded graph.
2. Walk over the complete CFG, filter out false positives and check for emptiness.
3. Finally, report only those blocks that are truly unreachable even after recursively considering entry points.

By following these concrete steps, the checker uses a simple and clear detection plan to identify and report unreachable code.
