## Bug Pattern

The checker identifies code segments that are never executed by detecting CFG blocks that have no corresponding execution paths (i.e. no ExplodedGraph nodes reached them). This indicates unreachable or dead code, usually caused by flawed control flow logic where conditions or branching structure inadvertently exclude some code paths.
