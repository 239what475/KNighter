Plan

1. Filter Out Irrelevant Cases
   • Immediately ignore casts to bool and casts originating from macros.
   • Use the ParentMap to obtain the parent AST node of the cast. If the cast is part of an explicit cast expression, ignore it so that only implicit casts remain.

2. Determine the Context for the Implicit Cast
   • Check if the parent statement is a binary operation (assignment, compound assignment, relational, or multiplicative operator) or a declaration/return statement.
   • Depending on the kind of operation, decide whether to check for loss of sign, loss of precision, or both:
     - For plain assignments and declarations/returns, test for both.
     - For arithmetic compound assignments (like addition/subtraction), only precision might be affected.
     - For multiplicative assignments and relational/multiplicative operators, check for loss of sign.
   
3. Check for Loss of Precision
   • In the helper isLossOfPrecision, first verify that the casted expression isn’t evaluatable (which means the analyzer cannot know its constant value) to avoid false positives.
   • Retrieve the destination type and the type of the subexpression.
   • If the destination type is floating-point, use its floating-point semantics to find the precision (the number of representable bits for integers). If it’s an integer, use its bit width.
   • Adjust the effective bit width (for instance, in signed integers, reserve a bit for the sign).
   • Compare the representable range of the destination against the source’s bit width. Use the CheckerContext’s isGreaterOrEqual to decide if the source value may exceed that range.

4. Check for Loss of Sign
   • In the helper isLossOfSign, ensure that the destination type is unsigned and the subexpression’s type is signed.
   • Use the CheckerContext’s isNegative on the subexpression to see if the original value could be negative. A negative value being cast to an unsigned type indicates a loss of sign.

5. Report the Bug
   • If either loss-of-sign or loss-of-precision is detected:
     - Generate a nonfatal error node via CheckerContext.
     - Create a bug report with an appropriate message (report separately if both issues are found).
     - Attach the relevant expression value to the report for clear diagnostics.
     - Emit the bug report.

This plan guides you through checking each implicit cast to catch any conversion where a negative value could be converted to an unsigned type, or where an integer value might not fit within the representable range of the destination type, warning the user appropriately.
