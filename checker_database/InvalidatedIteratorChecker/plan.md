Your checker is designed to detect when an invalidated iterator is being accessed. In other words, it checks whether an iterator that has been invalidated (for example, by a previous modification) is later used in a dereference or access operation. Below is a concrete, step‐by‐step plan that explains how the checker performs its detection.

--------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Intercept potential iterator accesses:
   • For function calls (checkPreCall):  
     – When a call is made to an overloaded operator that accesses container elements (using isAccessOperator to check the operator), retrieve the “this” pointer for instance methods (or the first argument otherwise) and pass it to the verification function.
   • For expressions (checkPreStmt):
     – Unary Operators: When a unary operator (e.g., operator* or operator->) is used (and it is not a use of CXXThis), get the sub-expression’s value and call the verification routine.
     – Binary Operators: For binary operators that are known to be access operators, take the left-hand side value and verify its iterator status.
     – Array Subscript Expressions: For an array subscript, retrieve the base object expression and verify access.
     – Member Expressions: For member accesses via pointer (arrow operator) that are explicitly written (not implicit), retrieve the base value and verify it.

2. Verify the iterator’s state:
   • In verifyAccess:
     – Use getIteratorPosition to extract the iterator’s internal “position” from the current state.
     – Check if that position is valid (by invoking isValid on it).
     – If the iterator is invalid (i.e. isValid returns false), then it means the iterator has been invalidated.

3. Report the bug:
   • When an invalidated iterator is detected:
     – Generate an error node using generateErrorNode.
     – Create a bug report with a clear message like "Invalidated iterator accessed."
     – Mark the iterator value as interesting in the report, and then emit the report using C.emitReport.

--------------------------------------------------
By following these clear and concrete steps, the checker intercepts all the common iterator-access patterns (through overloaded operators and various expressions) and then verifies the iterator position before any access is made. If the position turns out to be invalid, it flags that access as a bug.

This simple plan should help you implement or understand the checker, ensuring each step is concrete and easy to follow.
