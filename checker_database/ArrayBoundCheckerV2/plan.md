Your goal is to flag any array accesses (or pointer dereferences) that fall outside of the allocated memory region. The checker “ArrayBoundCheckerV2” does this by computing a symbolic offset into an array (or buffer) and then comparing it against the allowed bounds. Here’s a simple, concrete plan with fewer steps:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Compute the Memory Offset

 • For the given memory access (for example, in an expression Arr[idx]), use the helper function (computeOffset) to determine the symbolic base region (the “array” or memory block) and the symbolic offset (expressed in bytes).

 • If the offset cannot be computed, then do nothing and return.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Check the Lower Bound

 • Once you have the computed offset, compare it against zero.

 • Use the helper (compareValueToThreshold) to see if the offset is below zero.  
  – If yes, then the pointer is accessing memory before the start of the array.  
  – Create a message (e.g., “Out of bound access to memory preceding …”) and report the bug with reportOOB.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Check the Upper Bound (Buffer Overflow)

 • Get the “dynamic extent” (the size) of the memory block using getDynamicExtent.  
 • Compare the computed offset (“ByteOffset”) with the extent using compareValueToThreshold.  
  – If the offset exceeds the known extent, then you have an out-of-bound access.

 • There is a special case when the access is within an “addressof” expression (e.g., &arr[size]) because that can be legal; in that case, if the offset equals the extent exactly, do not warn.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Check for Tainted Offsets

 • If the computed offset is “tainted” (meaning its value comes from untrusted input), then even if the bounds check is not conclusive in the usual way, report an error warning about a “tainted” index or offset.
 • Prepare diagnostic messages that highlight the potential risk of using a tainted offset.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Report the Error

 • For all error cases (either lower-bound, upper-bound, or tainted-offset errors), generate a new error node.
 • Construct a bug report with a short message and a detailed explanation.  
 • Use reportOOB to emit the report with the current program state and attach any interesting symbols if applicable (for the tainted case).

------------------------------------------------------------
6. Exclude False Positives

 • If the expression comes from certain system macros (for example, if the access is due to a ctype macro in glibc), then ignore it.
 • Also, check for special cases (like taking the address of the element at [size]) to avoid reporting legal code.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. Handle Different Expression Forms

 • In addition to array subscripts, the checker also handles dereferences in UnaryOperator (deref) and MemberExpr when used with pointers.
 • For each of these kinds of expressions, perform the same offset computation and bounds check.

------------------------------------------------------------
By following these concrete steps, you will set up a simple, yet effective, detection plan for out-of-bound memory accesses. Each step is tied directly to one of the callbacks or helper functions in the checker:
 – computeOffset: finds the base region and offset.
 – compareValueToThreshold: compares against bounds.
 – getDynamicExtent: obtains the size of the array.
 – reportOOB: central point for issuing an error.

This step-by-step plan should help you write a correct and minimal checker for detecting out-of-bound array accesses in Clang Static Analyzer.
