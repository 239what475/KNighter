Your plan here

1. Hook on bit casts:
   • In the checkPostStmt callback for ImplicitCastExpr, first verify that the cast kind is CK_BitCast. This ensures that only relevant implicit casts (those that might change the dynamic type) are processed.

2. Retrieve the memory region:
   • Obtain the SVal from the ImplicitCastExpr and extract its corresponding MemRegion. If no region is found, simply return as there’s nothing to analyze.

3. Get dynamic type information:
   • Using the current program state (via getDynamicTypeInfo), extract the dynamic type info for the retrieved MemRegion. If the dynamic type information is not valid (meaning DynamicTypePropagation did not mark the region), then exit.

4. Compare dynamic and static types:
   • Retrieve the static type from the ImplicitCastExpr and the dynamic type from the dynamic type info.
   • Check if both types are Objective-C pointer types. (Skip the analysis if one of them isn’t, or if they relate to ObjC generics that are handled by another checker.)
   • Also ensure that both types have a definition available (so the checker can properly compare them).

5. Normalize types for comparison:
   • Remove “kindof” qualifiers from both the dynamic and static types by using the appropriate stripping function. This makes sure that subtype relationships are correctly inspected without interference from “kindof” wrappers.

6. Perform subtype/assignment checks:
   • Check if the stripped static type is assignable from the dynamic type using the ASTContext’s canAssignObjCInterfaces. If it is (indicating a compatible type relation), do nothing.
   • Also consider the case where the dynamic type might be a subclass and the assignment is still valid. If that is the case, the checker should not report a bug.

7. Report on mismatch:
   • If none of the above conditions hold, call a helper function (reportTypeError) to generate a bug report.
   • This report should include:
     - A concrete message stating that the object’s dynamic type (printed) does not match its static type.
     - An attached visitor (DynamicTypeBugVisitor) that walks back through the nodes if the dynamic type information changed along the execution path.
     - The source range of the relevant cast statement, highlighting the location of the problem.

8. Emit the diagnostic:
   • Finally, use the CheckerContext to emit the created bug report. This will flag the potential type error to the user with detailed diagnostics and context.

Each step is designed to be as concrete as possible so that you can follow along and write the checker correctly while keeping the overall procedure straightforward.
