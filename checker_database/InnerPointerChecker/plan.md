Your plan should be simple and concrete. Here’s a step‐by‐step plan outlining what the checker does and what you need to write:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Register and Manage Program State Maps

   • Use REGISTER_SET_FACTORY_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE and REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE to create:
     – A RawPtrMap that maps a container object’s MemRegion to a set of SymbolRefs.
     – A PtrSet (a set of symbols) that will track raw pointer symbols returned by container member functions.
     
   • This map will let you record which inner pointers belong to which container object.

2. Identify Container Member Functions and Pointer Access

   • Define several CallDescription objects (e.g., AppendFn, AssignFn, ClearFn, EraseFn, etc.) to model the container APIs that may invalidate inner pointers (for example, operations that could reallocate or clear out the container’s buffer).
   
   • Also define CallDescriptions (like CStrFn, DataFn, DataMemberFn) for functions that return a raw pointer to the container’s inner buffer.
   
   • In helper functions (isInvalidatingMemberFunction and isInnerPointerAccessFunction), check whether the current call matches these descriptions.

3. Track the Inner Pointer When It Is Returned

   • In the checkPostCall callback:
     
     - If the call is an inner pointer access function (determined by isInnerPointerAccessFunction):
       ▪ Retrieve the container object’s MemRegion (for example, from the first argument of the call).
       ▪ Get the return value of the call. If it is a symbol (SymbolRef), then add this symbol to the PtrSet for that container object in the RawPtrMap.
       ▪ Use the PtrSet factory (see the RawPtrMap registration) to update the set in the program state, then add the new state transition.

4. Invalidate Tracked Inner Pointers When the Container Changes

   • Still in checkPostCall:
     
     - If the call is a method on a container (an instance call) and is determined to be an invalidating member function (by isInvalidatingMemberFunction), retrieve the container object’s MemRegion from the CXXThis value.
     
     - Then call a helper (markPtrSymbolsReleased) to:
       ▪ Look up the set of pointer symbols for that container in the RawPtrMap.
       ▪ For each tracked symbol, mark it as “released” (using allocation_state::markReleased) so that subsequent use can be flagged (for a use-after-free or invalid access).
       ▪ Finally, remove the mapping for that MemRegion from the RawPtrMap and add the updated state.
     
   • Also, in checkPostCall, check if any non-const reference parameters of standard library functions (that take a basic_string by non-const reference) are called. Then, mark any associated inner pointers as released (via checkFunctionArguments).

5. Clean Up Dead Symbols

   • In the checkDeadSymbols callback:
     
     - Walk through the RawPtrMap and for each container MemRegion, check if the region (or any of the pointer symbols in its set) is dead.
     
     - Remove the dead regions or purge dead symbols from the pointer set.
     
     - Add a state transition with the cleaned-up RawPtrMap.
     
6. Bug Reporting (Optional Visitor)

   • Implement an InnerPointerBRVisitor:
     
     - Create a visitor that attaches extra diagnostic information when a bug (like use-after-free of an inner pointer) is reported.
     
     - In the VisitNode method, check if the pointer symbol is still being tracked. If it isn’t (because its container has been released), then attach additional context (for example, “Pointer to inner buffer of … obtained here”) to the bug report.
     
   • Register this visitor so that when the bug is emitted, a note is attached to help users understand where the inner pointer came from.

------------------------------------------------------------

By following these concrete steps:
• First, initialize program state maps for tracking inner pointer symbols.
• Second, intercept calls that acquire inner pointers (via checkPostCall) and record them.
• Third, intercept calls that modify the container (again in checkPostCall or in a helper for function arguments) and mark any associated pointer symbols as released.
• Finally, use checkDeadSymbols to clean the state and, optionally, provide enriched diagnostics with a bug report visitor.

This clear, few-step plan should help you write a correct implementation for the InnerPointerChecker.
