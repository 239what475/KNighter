## Bug Pattern

The checker implements a taint‐tracking mechanism but its core pattern is the failure to “normalize” or propagate taint tags correctly when values undergo transformations—such as being cast, incorporated into composite structures, or accessed via subregions. In other words, if a value originally marked as tainted is later wrapped in a SymbolCast, derived into a new symbol, or referenced via a subregion, the taint may not automatically “flow” correctly. This abstraction failure can lead to unsanitized or untracked tainted data being used in sensitive operations, which is the root of many security vulnerabilities where untrusted input isn’t properly validated or sanitized.
