Your checker isn’t “detecting” a bug by itself but instead provides a set of utility functions and program‐state maps that other checkers (or later parts of the analysis) can use to determine whether specific values are tainted. In other words, its “detection plan” is to propagate and later check taint status through the program state. Here’s a simple, concrete breakdown of its plan:

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Register and Maintain Taint-Related Maps

• The checker first registers a map (TaintMap) with the program state that records fully tainted symbols:
  – It maps a symbol (SymbolRef) to a taint tag (TaintTagType).  
• It also registers maps for handling partial taint:
  – TaintedSubRegions is registered via a factory so that individual subregions within a compound value can be marked.
  – DerivedSymTaint uses these subregion markers to record, for a given symbol, which portions (subregions) are tainted.
  
This setup enables the checker to keep track of which parts of a value or memory region are “tainted” (i.e. potentially coming from unsafe or untrusted sources).

--------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Adding Taint to Values

• The checker provides various overloads of addTaint:
  – Given a statement (and its corresponding SVal) or an SVal directly,
  – Or given a memory region.
  – Finally, when provided a symbol, the function walks through any symbol casts (so that the underlying symbol is used) and then updates the program state by setting an entry in TaintMap.
• If an SVal represents a structure (for example, a lazy compound value), it can “mass-taint” all of its stored elements by using a default binding, and then if a symbol is found inside, that symbol is recorded with a call to addPartialTaint.

This mechanism ensures that when some expression or memory region should be marked as “tainted,” its symbol (or its parts) are recorded in the program state.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Removing Taint

• Similar to adding taint, the removeTaint functions work by:
  – Extracting the SymbolRef from an SVal or from a MemRegion (handling symbol casts similarly), and then
  – Removing the taint entry from TaintMap in the program state.
  
Removing taint is essential when the value is sanitized, so future checks can query the state and see no taint.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 4. Querying for Taint (Detection Logic)

• The checker offers several isTainted functions that check a value (or a region/symbol) for taint.
  – They call the common helper getTaintedSymbolsImpl to traverse the value.
  – This helper considers various aspects:
   – If the given SVal is a symbol, it checks TaintMap.
   – If it is a memory region, it recurses by extracting the base region (or even the index in an array).
   – If the value is a compound value (such as through subregions), then it inspects the DerivedSymTaint map.
  – The function returns a (possibly empty) list of tainted symbols.
  
When another checker later wishes to know if a value is dangerous (tainted), it calls these helpers. In effect, the propagation rules defined here enable detection of issues like using unsanitized data.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 5. Partial Taint Propagation

• When only parts of a structure are tainted, the addPartialTaint function is invoked:
  – It first checks if the entire parent symbol is already marked as tainted.
  – If not, it marks a specific subregion (which is not the same as the complete region) in the DerivedSymTaint map.
  
This subtler mechanism lets the analyzer reason about cases when only a part (for example, a field within a struct) is hazardous.

--------------------------------------------------
How It All Works Together

• Other checkers (or later phases in an analysis) call taint::addTaint when they see a suspicious allocation or data source.
• As data flows through the program, values propagate their taint status; overloaded functions take care of carrying this information.
• Before performing sensitive operations (like copying data to user-controlled buffers), a checker can then call isTainted to decide whether to warn about unsanitized data.
• Removing taint later is also possible if sanitization routines are applied.

--------------------------------------------------
Your Simple Detection Plan (in pseudocode):

Your plan here
--------------------------------------------------
1. Initialize Program State:
 – Register TaintMap, TaintedSubRegions, and DerivedSymTaint in the analyzer state.

2. On a suspicious source:
 – Extract the SVal from the offending statement.
 – Remove casts and fetch the SymbolRef.
 – Mark this symbol as tainted by updating TaintMap with a chosen TaintTag.
 – If dealing with a compound value, mark subregions using DerivedSymTaint (via addPartialTaint).

3. When checking sensitive sinks:
 – Retrieve the SVal and extract the corresponding symbol or region.
 – Invoke isTainted (which calls getTaintedSymbolsImpl) to see if the value is tainted.
 – If tainted, issue a warning or error based on the analysis outcome.

4. When sanitization is performed:
 – Call removeTaint with the sanitized SVal to clear its taint.

--------------------------------------------------
This approach is simple and modular. Each utility function is concrete and self-contained, letting you later “plug in” this taint propagation into other bug detectors or safety checks in the static analyzer.

Using these precise, step-by-step propagation and query rules, your checker makes it easy to track and detect the flow of untrusted data throughout the code.
