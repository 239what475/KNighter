Your plan should follow these simple, concrete steps:

1. Initialize the protection constants and option overrides  
   • Define the integer constants for protection flags:  
  – PROT_WRITE = 0x02  
  – PROT_EXEC  = 0x04  
  – PROT_READ  = 0x01  
   • In your checker’s constructor or during registration, retrieve any override values from the analyzer options and store them into member variables (ProtExecOv and ProtReadOv).  
   • Update the default constants (ProtExec and ProtRead) with these override values if provided.

2. Intercept calls to mmap or mprotect in the checkPreCall callback  
   • Use the CallDescription objects (one for mmap with 6 arguments, one for mprotect with 3 arguments) to check if the current call is one of the target functions.  
   • Use a helper like matchesAny(Call, MmapFn, MprotectFn) to filter relevant calls.

3. Extract and validate the protection value  
   • Get the 3rd argument (index 2) from the call via Call.getArgSVal(2).  
   • Convert the argument to a concrete integer (nonloc::ConcreteInt). If the conversion fails (the argument isn’t a concrete integer), skip further analysis.

4. Adjust the protection constants with override values (if present)  
   • Check if ProtExecOv differs from the default ProtExec. If so, update ProtExec with ProtExecOv.  
   • Likewise, update ProtRead with ProtReadOv if needed.  
   • Optionally, if the new ProtRead equals ProtExec, exit early (this step is used to avoid false positives based on override option settings).

5. Check if both write and execute flags are set  
   • Compute the bitmask by checking if (Prot & (Prot_WRITE | Prot_EXEC)) equals (Prot_WRITE | Prot_EXEC).  
   • This condition means both flags are simultaneously enabled, which is potentially dangerous.

6. Report a bug if the dangerous configuration is detected  
   • If both PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC are set, generate an error node using C.generateNonFatalErrorNode().  
   • Create a bug report with a clear message (e.g., "Both PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC flags are set. This can lead to exploitable memory regions...").  
   • Add the source range of the protection argument from the call to the bug report.  
   • Finally, emit the report via C.emitReport().

Following these concrete steps will help you write the checker that detects mmap or mprotect calls where the protection flags enable both writable and executable permissions, which is the goal of the MmapWriteExecChecker.
