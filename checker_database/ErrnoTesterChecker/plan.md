Your plan is to “simulate” the behavior of several errno‐related functions by intercepting calls (using eval::Call) and then updating the program state to model errno accordingly. This is achieved by:

1. Checking whether the current call matches one of the registered “test functions” using a CallDescriptionMap.  
2. For each matching function, updating (or reading) errno via helper functions (like setErrnoValue, getErrnoValue, setErrnoState) provided by the errno_modeling module.  
3. Creating multiple state transitions (if needed) to mimic both the success and failure cases the simulated functions can return.  
4. Attaching optional notes to the transitions (using getErrnoNoteTag) to explain the assumptions the checker makes about errno usage.

Below is a concrete step-by-step plan:

--------------------------------------------------
Your plan here
--------------------------------------------------

Step 1. Register Test Functions  
• Create a map (TestCalls) that links each test function signature (function name and argument count) with its evaluation function (EvalFn).  
  ○ Example:  
    – "ErrnoTesterChecker_setErrno" expects one argument and its eval function is evalSetErrno.  
    – "ErrnoTesterChecker_getErrno" expects zero arguments and is handled in evalGetErrno.  
    – Others simulate functions that either succeed or fail (or produce multiple outcomes).

Step 2. Intercept the Call in evalCall  
• In the evalCall callback, look up the current call in the TestCalls map.  
• If a matching EvalFn is found, invoke it with the current CheckerContext and CallEvent.  
• Return whether the state was modified using C.isDifferent().

Step 3. Modeling errno Setting/Getting  
For each EvalFn, update the program state as follows:

 A. evalSetErrno  
  ○ Retrieve the argument (an integer value) from the call (Call.getArgSVal(0)).  
  ○ Update the state by calling setErrnoValue with the provided value and an “irrelevant” flag.  
  ○ Propagate the new state via C.addTransition.

 B. evalGetErrno  
  ○ Retrieve the current errno value from the state (using getErrnoValue).  
  ○ Assert that errno value exists.  
  ○ Bind the retrieved errno value to the return expression of the call.  
  ○ Propagate the new state.

 C. evalSetErrnoIfError  
  ○ Model a function that can either succeed or fail:  
    – Success: Bind the return value to 0 and mark errno as “MustNotBeChecked” (since errno isn’t used in success).  
    – Failure: Bind the return value to 1 and set errno to a fixed value (11) using setErrnoValue.  
  ○ Propagate both state transitions using C.addTransition.

 D. evalSetErrnoIfErrorRange  
  ○ Similar to (C), but for the failure branch, build a symbolic errno value (using SVB.conjureSymbolVal) and then constrain it (via assume) to represent a nonzero range.  
  ○ Create two transitions: one for success (return 0) and one for failure (return 1 with the range set errno).  
  ○ Propagate both transitions.

 E. evalSetErrnoCheckState  
  ○ This function distinguishes three cases:  
    – Success: Return 0; errno remains undefined (set as MustNotBeChecked).  
    – Failure1: Return 1; errno set to a fixed value (1) with “Irrelevant” flag.  
    – Failure2: Return 2; errno set to 2 and flagged as “MustBeChecked” (indicating that the caller should check errno).  
  ○ Attach an explanatory note (using getErrnoNoteTag) for the success transition and the failure2 transition.  
  ○ Propagate all three state transitions.

Step 4. Propagation and Finalization  
• After processing, ensure that each branch (transition) is added to the analysis by calling C.addTransition.  
• The updated state carries along information about errno (or its “check state”) so that later parts of the analysis can pick up the modeled behavior if needed.

This plan uses the simplest method by:  
• Intercepting only function calls (via eval::Call),  
• Using a straightforward mapping from call description to evaluation functions, and  
• Creating a small number of state transitions per function according to the expected behavior.

By following these concrete steps, you can implement a correct errno modeling checker that simulates various errno-related behaviors and properly handles multiple outcomes in a single function call.
