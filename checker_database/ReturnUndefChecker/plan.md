Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Analyze the Return Statement:
   • In the callback for pre-statement processing on a return statement (checkPreStmt), obtain the return expression.
   • Skip further checking if the return expression is missing.

2. Get the SVal and Function Return Type:
   • Retrieve the SVal (symbolic value) representing the return expression.
   • Get the declared return type from the current function (using the StackFrameContext) so you know if the function returns void or a reference type.

3. Handle Undefined (Garbage) Return Values:
   • If the SVal is undefined (isUndef() returns true), then first allow cases where returning an undefined value is acceptable:
     – Functions declared with a void return type.
     – Blocks where the return value is of void type.
   • If not acceptable, use a helper function (emitUndef) to generate a bug report indicating that an undefined or garbage value is being returned.

4. Check for Returning Null References:
   • If the function’s return type is a reference type, call an additional helper (checkReference) that:
     – Splits the program state via an assumption into “non-null” and “null” states.
     – If a non-null state exists, simply add the new state transition.
     – If the state indicates that the value is null, emit a bug report specifying that a null reference is being returned.
   • Use getDerefExpr (if available) to track the expression that caused the null dereference for extra reporting detail.

5. Bug Reporting:
   • Both emitUndef and checkReference call a helper (emitBug) to generate the error node.
   • The report attaches the source range for the return expression and associates the tracked expression value for clarity.
   • The two BugType instances are used:
     – BT_Undef for undefined/garbage values.
     – BT_NullReference for returning a null reference.

6. Register the Checker:
   • At the end, the ReturnUndefChecker is registered via registerReturnUndefChecker.
   • The shouldRegisterReturnUndefChecker helper ensures that the checker is always activated.

------------------------------------------------------------

This plan outlines the detection steps in a simple, step-by-step manner. Each step is concrete, guiding you to:
– Check the return value’s definedness.
– Handle special cases for void functions.
– Split the state for reference types to report null references.
– Finally, issue the appropriate bug report with a clear explanation.

Following these steps will allow you to write a correct ReturnUndefChecker that flags both undefined return values (except in valid cases) and null references.
