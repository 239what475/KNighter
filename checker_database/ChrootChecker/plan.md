Your plan:

1. In evalCall, intercept calls to both chroot and chdir:
   • If the call is to chroot, call your helper (evalChroot) that sets the jail state. Use the global data map (GDM) to store ROOT_CHANGED.
   • If the call is to chdir, call your helper (evalChdir) that checks if the argument is the string "/" and, if so, updates the jail state to JAIL_ENTERED.

2. In evalChroot:
   • Retrieve the current program state and use the state manager to add an entry (using a unique tag) that marks the state as ROOT_CHANGED.
   • Transition to the new state.

3. In evalChdir:
   • Retrieve the call argument.
   • Strip any casts from the argument’s memory region to get at the underlying StringRegion. If the string literal equals "/" then update the state (via the state manager) to JAIL_ENTERED.
   • Transition to the new state.

4. In checkPreCall:
   • For every call (except those to chroot and chdir) retrieve the jail state from the GDM.
   • If the state is still ROOT_CHANGED (meaning no chdir("/") occurred right after a chroot), then generate a bug report warning that there’s a potential for breaking out of the chroot jail.
   
Each step uses a concrete state transition using the GDM and then checks for that state before other calls occur. This design ensures a simple, state-driven check for proper chroot/jail usage:

Your plan here
------------------------------------------------

1. Intercept calls:
   • In evalCall, if the call matches chroot or chdir then delegate to evalChroot or evalChdir respectively.
  
2. In evalChroot:
   • Retrieve the current state.
   • Add the key (unique tag) to the GDM with the value ROOT_CHANGED.
   • Transition to this updated state.

3. In evalChdir:
   • Retrieve the argument expression (first argument).
   • Strip casting from the argument to access the underlying StringRegion.
   • Check if the string literal equals "/" (meaning chdir("/") is called).
   • If so, update the state by storing JAIL_ENTERED in the GDM.
   • Transition to the updated state.

4. In checkPreCall:
   • For any call that is not chroot or chdir, look up the jail state.
   • If the state exists and equals ROOT_CHANGED (indicating chdir("/") was not called immediately after chroot), then generate a bug report (using a nonfatal error node) that indicates the potential to break out of jail.

Following these concrete steps will let you correctly implement and understand the state transitions in the checker so that you can catch misuse of chroot.
