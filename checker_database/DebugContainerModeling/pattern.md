## Bug Pattern

The checker assumes that calls meant to extract container iterator state (via functions like clang_analyzer_container_begin/end) are always given a valid container argument with proper internal data. In cases where the container argument is missing or its associated debug data cannot be retrieved, the checker falls back (or even just reports a debug message) and may not update the program state correctly. This pattern—implicitly assuming the presence and validity of container data without robust checking and state propagation—can lead to unsound modeling of container iterators and incorrect analysis results in similar contexts.
