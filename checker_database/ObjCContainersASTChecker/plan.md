Your plan for detecting invalid usage of CoreFoundation container creation APIs is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create an AST checker by subclassing Checker<check::ASTCodeBody> and implement the checkASTCodeBody callback:
   • This callback obtains the function or method body (i.e. the AST) to be analyzed.
   • It creates and uses a helper class to traverse the AST.

2. Define a helper class (e.g., WalkAST) that inherits from StmtVisitor:
   • Its constructor should capture the BugReporter, Checker pointer, and the AnalysisDeclContext.
   • Also, retrieve the ASTContext and the target pointer width. This width is used to check if a type is “pointer-sized.”

3. In the WalkAST class, implement the VisitCallExpr method:
   • Retrieve the callee name via the CallExpr’s direct callee.
   • For the following CoreFoundation functions:
     - CFArrayCreate and CFSetCreate:
       ▪ Ensure the number of arguments is exactly 4.
       ▪ For the second argument (index 1), remove casts and obtain its type.
       ▪ Use a helper function (hasPointerToPointerSizedType) to check if the argument is a C array of pointer-sized values.
       ▪ If the argument is valid (i.e. has pointer-sized type elements), then do nothing; otherwise, report an error.
     - CFDictionaryCreate:
       ▪ Check that six arguments are provided.
       ▪ For the first two arguments (indexes 1 and 2), remove casts and test using hasPointerToPointerSizedType.
       ▪ Only if both parameters meet the criteria do you allow it; otherwise, report an error.
   • Construct an error message that clearly explains which argument is incorrect. For example, describe which argument (the “second” or “third”) is expected to be an array of pointer-sized values.
   • Use the BugReporter to emit the report. Use PathDiagnosticLocation (created from the call expression) to pinpoint the location.

4. In the helper, implement the function hasPointerToPointerSizedType:
   • Check if the expression’s type is either a pointer or an array where the underlying element’s size equals the pointer width.
   • Also allow a null pointer constant since that is acceptable.
   • This helper determines if the argument is of the appropriate “pointer-suitable” type.

5. Implement a VisitChildren method in the WalkAST helper:
   • Recursively visit all children statements in the AST.
   • This ensures that nested call expressions are analyzed.

6. In the checkASTCodeBody method of your checker:
   • Instantiate the WalkAST helper (passing the appropriate analysis context).
   • Start the traversal from the AST body of the declaration.

7. Register your checker with the CheckerManager:
   • Follow the standard checker registration function (e.g., registerObjCContainersASTChecker) and return true from shouldRegisterObjCContainersASTChecker.

This plan keeps the implementation simple by concentrating on:
   • Visiting only the call expressions in the AST.
   • Checking for the exact number of arguments and specific argument conditions.
   • Reporting an error if the arguments do not meet the requirements.

With this step‐by‐step plan, you can write a correct checker that emits a clear diagnostic message when the arguments passed to CF container creation functions are of an incorrect type.
