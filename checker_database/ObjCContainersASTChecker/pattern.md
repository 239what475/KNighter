## Bug Pattern

Using CoreFoundation container creation functions (such as CFArrayCreate, CFSetCreate, or CFDictionaryCreate) with an array argument that does not consist of pointer-sized values. The checker detects when the expected C array argument (typically the second or third parameter) is of an incompatible type (i.e., its element type does not have the size of a pointer), indicating a potential mismatch that could lead to runtime errors.
