Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Trigger on Objective-C Message Sending:
   • Use the checkPreObjCMessage callback to intercept every Objective-C message.
   • First, verify the message is an instance message (not a class message).

2. Verify the Receiver’s Type:
   • Retrieve the receiver’s interface declaration.
   • Check that the interface identifier is "NSAutoreleasePool".
   • This ensures that you are only interested in messages sent to NSAutoreleasePool objects.

3. Identify the “release” Selector:
   • Initialize a Selector variable (releaseS) to the nullary selector "release" if it isn’t already set.
   • Compare the message’s selector against this "release" selector.

4. Report the Violation:
   • If the message is a release message sent to an NSAutoreleasePool, generate a non-fatal error node.
   • Build a bug report with a clear message advising the use of -drain instead of -release.
   • Highlight the source range of the offending message in the report.
   • Finally, emit the bug report to alert the user.

------------------------------------------------------------
This plan uses a minimal number of concrete steps and conditions. You simply:

• Filter for instance messages sent to NSAutoreleasePool.
• Check if the method called is "release".
• Emit a bug report recommending the upgrade from -release to -drain.

Follow these steps directly in your checker’s code to construct a correct and functioning NSAutoreleasePoolChecker.
