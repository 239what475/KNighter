## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is the misuse of NSAutoreleasePool in a garbage-collected environment by sending it a -release message instead of calling -drain. This arises when code explicitly sends the -release message to an NSAutoreleasePool object while running with Objective-C garbage collection enabled, even though -drain is the appropriate method to invoke in that context.
