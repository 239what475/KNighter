Your plan is to have the checker “simulate” how an iterator is modeled for debugging by intercepting calls to three special functions and extracting (or synthesizing) their corresponding internal fields. In other words, the checker is not flagging a bug in user code but is “debugging” analyzer assumptions about iterator modeling. Here’s a concrete, step‐by‐step plan:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

Step 1. Setup the Checker as an eval::Call Checker  
  • The checker is registered to run on every call (as an eval::Call callback).  
  • In its evalCall method, it attempts to match the call against a list of expected iterator-related functions.

Step 2. Identify the Called Function  
  • The checker maintains a CallDescriptionMap that maps function names and the expected number of arguments to member functions.  
  • Specifically, it looks for functions named:  
  – "clang_analyzer_iterator_position"  
  – "clang_analyzer_iterator_container"  
  – "clang_analyzer_iterator_validity"  
  • If the call signature matches any entry in the CallDescriptionMap, the corresponding handler (a FnCheck pointer) is selected.

Step 3. Dispatch to the Appropriate Handler  
  • The evalCall method casts the call’s origin expression to a CallExpr.  
  • It uses the CallDescriptionMap to look up the appropriate handler based on the call’s description.  
  • If a handler is found, the handler is invoked; otherwise, the call is ignored.

Step 4. Process the Iterator Value via analyzerIteratorDataField  
  • Each handler (for the three functions) calls the helper function analyzerIteratorDataField. This function has several concrete steps:  
  a. Verify Argument Presence  
   – Check that the CallExpr has at least one argument.  
   – If no argument is present, report a debug message ("Missing iterator argument") using reportDebugMsg.  
  b. Retrieve the Iterator Data  
   – Get the SVal (symbolic value) of the first argument.  
   – Extract the IteratorPosition pointer by calling getIteratorPosition with the state and this value.  
  c. Compute the Result from the IteratorPosition  
   – If the iterator position was found, call a provided function (the “getter”) to compute the field of interest. For example:  
    • For position: retrieve the offset (converted to a SymbolVal).  
    • For container: retrieve the container (converted to a MemRegionVal).  
    • For validity: retrieve a boolean (converted to a concrete integer).  
   – If no iterator value is found, use a provided default value.  
  d. Bind the Result to the Call Expression  
   – Bind the computed SVal as the result of the CallExpr so that the state reflects the value of the iterator’s property.  
  e. Add the Modified State Transition  
   – The new state is added to the checker’s list of state transitions.

Step 5. Reporting Diagnostic Messages  
  • The helper function reportDebugMsg creates a non-fatal error node.  
  • It then emits a bug report with the provided debug message. Even though this is not a “bug report” in the traditional sense, it serves as a way to check that the analyzer’s assumptions are as expected.

Step 6. Finalize and Register the Checker  
  • The state transitions propagate the synthesized iterator fields into the analysis state.  
  • Finally, the checker is registered via the CheckerManager so that it will be executed during the analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------
This plan follows a simple and direct approach:  
1. Register an eval::Call checker.  
2. Use a map to associate specific iterator debug functions to custom handlers.  
3. In each handler, check for a valid iterator argument, extract or synthesize its data field, bind that information to the call expression, and report a debug message if needed.  

Each of these concrete steps ensures that the checker is easy to follow, and the state transitions correctly model the iterator’s internal state for debugging purposes.
