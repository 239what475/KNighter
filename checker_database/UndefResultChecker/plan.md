Your plan should follow these concrete steps:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Identify the target BinaryOperator node:
   • Use the checkPostStmt callback that runs after evaluating every BinaryOperator.
   • Retrieve the symbolic value (SVal) of the entire BinaryOperator expression using C.getSVal(B).

2. Check for an undefined result:
   • If the SVal of the BinaryOperator is undefined, then continue; otherwise, do nothing.
   • Before reporting an error, check if the operator occurs within a function named "swap". If it does, skip the report because swap functions are allowed to have partially uninitialized values.

3. Generate an error node:
   • Call C.generateErrorNode() to mark the location in the exploded graph.
   • If no node is generated (because the state has been merged or an error has been reported already), then exit.

4. Determine which operand is responsible:
   • Examine both operands. If the left operand (B->getLHS()) evaluates to an undefined SVal, mark that operand as problematic and set a flag (isLeft true).
   • Otherwise, if the right operand (B->getRHS()) is undefined, mark that operand and set isLeft false.
   • If an operand is found, get its cleaned-up (IgnoreParenCasts) expression for use in the error message.
   • Additionally, if the operand causing undefined is part of an ArraySubscriptExpr, then use the helper (isArrayIndexOutOfBounds) to determine if the undefined value is due to an out-of-bounds index. Append that extra detail to the error message.

5. Construct the error message:
   • If an operand was identified as undefined, prepare a message like:
       "The left/right operand of '<operator>' is a garbage value"
     • If isArrayIndexOutOfBounds returns true, append:
       " due to array index out of bounds"
   • If no specific operand is undefined (though the result is), produce a generic message like:
       "The result of the '<operator>' expression is undefined"

6. Create and populate a bug report:
   • Use the PathSensitiveBugReport object initialized with the BugType (pre-initialized with the message "Result of operation is garbage or undefined") and the error message created.
   • Tag the report with the source code range of the problematic expression, so the user can locate it easily.
   • Optionally, call bugreporter::trackExpressionValue to attach the problematic expression’s data flow to the report.

7. Emit the report:
   • Finally, use C.emitReport() to issue the bug report, effectively alerting the user about the undefined result.

By following these concrete steps, you can write a checker that reports the usage of garbage (undefined) results in binary operations with clear, actionable information for the developer.
