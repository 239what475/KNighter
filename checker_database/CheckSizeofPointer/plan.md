Your goal is to warn when code uses sizeof() on a pointer value unintentionally. Here’s a simple, concrete plan in a few steps:

 Step 1: Create an AST Visitor  
  • Define a class (WalkAST) derived from StmtVisitor that will traverse the AST starting from the function body.  
  • In the VisitStmt method, call VisitChildren to recursively process each child node.

 Step 2: Identify sizeof() Expressions  
  • In WalkAST, implement a method VisitUnaryExprOrTypeTraitExpr that receives nodes representing UnaryExprOrTypeTraitExpr (sizeof, alignof, etc.).  
  • Check that the kind is sizeof: compare E->getKind() to UETT_SizeOf.  
  • Skip cases where the sizeof is invoked on an explicit type (E->isArgumentType() returns true) because this is likely intentional.

 Step 3: Check for Pointer Type Arguments  
  • Retrieve the argument’s type via E->getTypeOfArgument().  
  • If the type is a pointer type (use T->isPointerType()), continue.  
  • However, if the corresponding argument expression is not a simple pointer variable reference (for example, not a DeclRefExpr after stripping parentheses), then it is likely a false positive such as in cases of dereferencing (e.g. sizeof *p).  
  • This extra check helps filter out intentional sizeof usage on dereferenced pointers.

 Step 4: Issue the Warning  
  • If the conditions above are met, create a source location using PathDiagnosticLocation with the beginning of the sizeof expression.  
  • Use BugReporter’s EmitBasicReport to emit a warning. Include:  
   – The declaration context (from the AnalysisDeclContext)  
   – A descriptive title such as “Potential unintended use of sizeof() on pointer type”  
   – A message explaining that using sizeof on a pointer may produce an unexpected result  
   – The source range of the pointer expression  
  • This step produces the diagnostic that will help the developer identify the issue.

 Step 5: Register the Checker  
  • Implement the checkASTCodeBody callback in your checker (SizeofPointerChecker) to instantiate and run the WalkAST visitor from the function body.  
  • In your checker registration function (registerSizeofPointerChecker), register your checker so that the analyzer invokes it when processing ASTs.

By following these steps, you create a focused checker that scans function bodies, identifies sizeof() expressions, inspects whether the argument type is a pointer, and issues a warning only when the expression is used in a suspicious context. This clear, step‑by‑step plan should help you write and understand the checker easily.
