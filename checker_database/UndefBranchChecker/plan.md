Your checker detects when a branch condition (the expression used in an if/while/etc.) evaluates to an undefined (i.e. “garbage”) value. Here’s a simple, concrete plan outlining the detection steps:

--------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Identify the branch condition:
   • In the checkBranchCondition callback, first verify that the condition is not part of an Objective-C collection loop (ObjCForCollectionStmt) since these have no condition.
   • Retrieve the symbolic value (SVal) of the entire condition expression.
   • If the SVal is not undefined, do nothing.

2. If the condition’s SVal is undefined:
   • Generate an error node using generateErrorNode. This creates a “sink” node that indicates the branch is unreachable under normal execution.

3. Pinpoint the root cause:
   • Retrieve the predecessor node and corresponding program state.
   • Use a helper (here the struct FindUndefExpr) to recursively inspect the expression’s subexpressions.
   • In each recursive call, check if a subexpression’s SVal is undefined (using MatchesCriteria).
   • By recursing into all children that meet the “undefined” criteria, select the most nested subexpression that triggers the bug. This helps in highlighting the specific part of the condition responsible for the undefined value.

4. Report the bug:
   • Create a bug report that contains the message “Branch condition evaluates to a garbage value.”
   • Attach the source range of the identified problematic subexpression so that it is clearly highlighted.
   • Use emitReport to communicate the bug to the user.

--------------------------------------------------
Following these concrete steps will let you write a checker that triggers a warning whenever an undefined value is used to control a branch, thereby highlighting potential logic errors in the code.
