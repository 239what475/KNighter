## Bug Pattern

The checker detects cases where a branch condition is computed from an uninitialized (undefined) value. In essence, it flags patterns where control-flow decisions (e.g., in if/while statements) depend on an expression that has not been properly initialized, leading to unpredictable or garbage behavior.
