Your plan is to follow these concrete steps:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Identify VLA Declarations and Size Expressions  
   • In checkPreStmt for DeclStmt, check if the declared type (or typedef underlying type) is a Variable Array Type.  
   • In checkPreStmt for UnaryExprOrTypeTraitExpr (specifically for sizeof), verify that the argument type is a VLA.  
   • Retrieve the list of VLA dimension expressions (each size expression), which may be nested for multidimensional VLAs.

2. Validate Each VLA Dimension Size  
   • For each dimension’s size expression, call a helper (checkVLAIndexSize) that:  
   – Retrieves the SVal for the expression using C.getSVal.  
   – Checks whether the size is undefined (using isUndef) and otherwise tainted (using isTainted) and reports an error if so.  
   – Checks the value against zero by assuming the size is not zero and then reporting a bug if a zero state is reached.  
   – Evaluates whether the size is negative by comparing with zero; if negative, report a bug.  
   • Ensure that, once a check fails (for undef, taint, zero, negative), the helper returns a null state to stop further analysis of that VLA.

3. Compute Total Array Size and Check Overflow  
   • Start with the element’s size (in char units) retrieved via ASTContext’s getTypeSizeInChars.  
   • For each collected VLA index expression, multiply the current size by the index length.  
   • At each multiplication, if the index size is statically known, check that multiplying does not overflow given the maximum size_t value (use your SValBuilder and known-value helpers).  
   • If an overflow is detected return an error by reporting a VLA_Overflow bug.

4. Report Bugs Immediately When Issues Are Found  
   • In checkVLAIndexSize, whenever an invalid size is detected (garbage, zero, negative, or overflow), use reportBug to create a concrete message and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport.  
   • In case the size is tainted, also call reportTaintBug, ensuring that any tainted symbols are marked as “interesting” in the bug report.

5. Update the Program State  
   • Once all dimensions are validated, update the program state with the total computed array size.  
   • For declarations (in DeclStmt), if the variable being declared is found, call setDynamicExtent to bind the calculated size (extent) to the VLA’s MemRegion.  
   • Always add a state transition with the updated assumptions so that subsequent analysis uses the corrected state.

6. Keep your Transitions Simple and State-Consistent  
   • At every check (both in checkPreStmt callbacks), ensure that if the state becomes null (i.e. an error is detected), you do not continue processing.  
   • Always add the new state transition (using C.addTransition(State)) after modifying it.

------------------------------------------------------------
By following these concrete steps, your checker will:
– Intercept all VLA declarations and sizeof usages.
– Validate every VLA dimension’s size for undefined, zero, negative, tainted, or overflow conditions.
– Report a concrete bug with a clear message when an issue is detected.
– Define the MemRegion’s extent for correct downstream analysis.

Each step is focused on simplicity: from intercepting the right AST nodes, validating each expression, computing sizes while checking for overflow, to finally reporting clear diagnostics and propagating new states—all in a small number of well-defined steps.
