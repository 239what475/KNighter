## Bug Pattern

Placement new is used with a storage buffer that does not meet the memory requirements of the allocated type. This pattern involves providing a storage region whose capacity is insufficient (or over-specified in case of arrays) or whose alignment does not match the alignment required by the type being constructed. Such misuse can lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption.
