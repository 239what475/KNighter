Your plan is to split the analysis into two distinct states: one where self-assignment is assumed (i.e. the parameter equals *this) and one where it is not. This lets subsequent checkers examine both cases separately. Here’s a simple, concrete step‐by‐step plan:

-------------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Check Function Context:
   - Verify that you are at the top frame (using C.inTopFrame()).
   - Retrieve the current function’s declaration from the location context.
   - Ensure that the current function is either a copy or move assignment operator.
   - If any of these conditions fail, do nothing and return.

2. Get “this” and Parameter Values:
   - From the ProgramState, obtain the “this” pointer value (using getSVal with a helper such as SVB.getCXXThis).
   - For the assignment operator, obtain the region (memory location) corresponding to the first parameter.
   - Get the parameter’s value from the state.

3. Generate the Self-Assignment State:
   - Create a new state ("SelfAssignState") by binding the parameter’s location to the “this” value.
   - This binding forces the analysis to assume that the parameter and *this are the same.
   - Generate a note tag with a descriptive message like "Assuming param == *this".
   - Add the state transition with the self-assignment note tag.

4. Generate the Non-Self-Assignment State:
   - Create another state ("NonSelfAssignState") by binding the parameter’s location to its original value.
   - This preserves the original case where the parameter might not be equal to *this.
   - Generate a note tag that indicates "Assuming param != *this".
   - Add this state transition with the appropriate note tag.

5. End:
   - The checker relies on later checkers to analyze both paths (self-assignment vs. non-self-assignment).
   - No reporting is done directly; only the bifurcation of states for further analysis.

-------------------------------------------------------

Following these steps will allow you to implement a clear self-assignment detection checker in Clang Static Analyzer, which doubles the analysis path for each assignment operator.
