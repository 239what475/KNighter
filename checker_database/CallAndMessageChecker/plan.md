Your detection plan can be organized into a few concrete steps. In short, the checker is built to intercept both C/C++ calls and Objective‑C message sends, and it verifies that:
 • Function pointers and object pointers are non‑null and initialized before a call.
 • The number of arguments meets function expectations.
 • In Objective‑C, the receiver is neither nil nor uninitialized.
 • For deallocation and method calls, the “this” pointer is valid.

Below is a step‐by‐step plan that you can follow:

---------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Initialization & Registration

   • Create several BugType objects (one per error kind) to report different warnings:
       – Function pointer uninitialized and null.
       – C++ “this” pointer issues (uninit or null).
       – Too few parameters in function calls.
       – Uninitialized argument values.
       – Nil receiver in Objective‑C messages.
   • Register the checker for events on:
       – Pre‑call: to check function calls.
       – Pre‑ObjCMessage: to check Objective‑C method calls.
       – ObjCMessageNil: to simulate messaging nil.
     
2. Handling Function Calls in checkPreCall

   • If the call is via a function pointer:
       – Retrieve the callee (using the call expression’s callee value).
       – If the function pointer is undefined, generate a “function pointer is uninitialized” report.
       – Otherwise, perform an assumption (using State->assume(...)) to check if the pointer is null and report accordingly.
     
   • Check parameter count:
       – Get the number of formal parameters and compare with the number of supplied arguments.
       – If there are too few arguments, report the bug using a bug report with the appropriate error message.
     
   • For C++ instance (method) calls:
       – Check that the “this” pointer (retrieved from the call event) is not uninitialized or null.
       – Report a bug if “this” is undefined or null.
     
   • For deallocation calls:
       – In C++ delete (or delete[]) checks, verify that the pointer argument is not undefined.
       – Report a relevant error if the pointer is undef.
     
   • For every argument in the call:
       – Call a helper function (PreVisitProcessArg) which inspects each argument for an undefined value.
       – If an argument (or any field within a passed compound value) is uninitialized, generate a bulleted report with details (source range, ordinal information, etc.).

3. Handling Objective‑C Message Calls

   • In checkPreObjCMessage:
       – Retrieve the receiver value. If it is undefined, report an “uninitialized receiver” bug.
       – Use different BugType messages depending on the kind of message (normal method call, property access, or subscript access).
     
   • In checkObjCMessageNil:
       – When a message is sent to nil, inspect the expected return type.
       – If the return type may lead to garbage or null‐reference issues (for example, a non‑structure type that is larger than a pointer), generate an error.
       – Otherwise, bind an appropriate zero value for the return.
     
   • In HandleNilReceiver:
       – Check if the return type is a C/C++ class or structure (which is safe because the compiler zero‑initializes them).
       – Otherwise, compare the type’s size with a pointer’s size (and consider architecture quirks) to decide if messaging nil is dangerous.
       – Issue a bug report if necessary.

4. Helper Functions and Reporting

   • PreVisitProcessArg:
       – This helper examines each argument (or field of a compound value) for an undefined (uninitialized) value.
       – If found, it uses a descriptive message (with ordinal terms, e.g. “1st argument”) and emits a bug report.
     
   • checkFunctionPointerCall, checkParameterCount, checkCXXMethodCall, checkCXXDeallocation, and checkArgInitializedness each update the program state (or “sink” the state when a bug is found) and then add the transition to the exploded graph.
     
   • All error reports are created via generateErrorNode and PathSensitiveBugReport, attaching the source range and tracking the problematic expression.

---------------------------------------------------------

By following these steps you ensure that any call (or message expression) is validated:
 • For valid function pointers and object pointers,
 • The required number of parameters,
 • And that the receiver in Objective‑C isn’t nil when it matters.

This plan uses a redundant yet straightforward approach: every callback (PreCall, PreObjCMessage, ObjCMessageNil) checks a specific aspect of the call/message, and helper functions are used to check for uninitialized or null values and then report errors with detailed diagnostics.
