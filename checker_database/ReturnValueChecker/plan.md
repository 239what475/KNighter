Below is a concrete, step‐by‐step plan for how ReturnValueChecker detects invariant “breaks” based on the checker code:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Define the Expected Return Value List  
   • Create a mapping (the CDM) from specific function names (and class–function pairs) to the expected boolean return value.  
   • In our code, functions like Error(), TokError(), and error() are mapped to “true.”

2. Process Function Calls (checkPostCall)  
   • When a function call returns, first check if the call’s signature is in the CDM.  
   • Retrieve the expected boolean value for this call from the CDM.  
   • Get the call’s actual return value (SVal) and use the helper isInvariantBreak() to compare the expected and actual values.  
     – This helper asks the program state: “If I assume this SVal is null, do I get a result that matches the expected value?”  
   • If isInvariantBreak() returns an “optional” value that is false (meaning the invariant is not yet broken), then update the state by “assuming” that the return value is the expected one.  
   • Attach a note tag that describes the function and expected return value so that later users (or the EndFunction check) can be informed about the guarantee.

3. Check the Function’s Return at End (checkEndFunction)  
   • When a function end is reached (via a ReturnStmt) in non-top stack frames, retrieve the caller’s call event from the state.  
   • Look up again in the CDM for the expected return value.  
   • Using isInvariantBreak(), compare the actual returned value from the function with the expected invariant.  
   • If the invariant is broken (that is, the actual value does not meet the expectation), generate a note tag with a message that indicates the broken invariant.  
   • Add a state transition using this note tag. (Downstream, this propagation can lead to bug reports that show the invariant discrepancy.)

4. Use Helper Functions for Clarity  
   • getName(): Build a descriptive function name (including the class name if applicable) that appears in the diagnostic messages.  
   • isInvariantBreak(): Encapsulate the logic to check whether the return value does (or does not) match the expected invariant by querying the program state’s constraints (using isConstrainedTrue()/False() on the SVal).

------------------------------------------------------------
Each step is as simple as possible, tracks state transitions related to the expected return value and uses explicit helper functions to keep the checker easy to follow. This plan should allow you to write (or modify) the ReturnValueChecker in a clear and correct manner.
