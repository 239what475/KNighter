## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is the inadvertent use of identical expressions in contexts where distinct expressions were likely intended. For example, when both operands of a binary operator (comparison, logical, or bitwise) are exactly the same or when the same condition is used for multiple branches (e.g., in if/else constructs or conditional operators). This leads to expressions that always evaluate to a constant truth value (true or false) or redundant code, indicating a possible logical error in the program.
