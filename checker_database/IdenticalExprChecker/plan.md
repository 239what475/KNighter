Your plan is to traverse the AST and look for binary operators, if‐statements, and conditional operators where the same expression appears on both “sides” (or both branches) unintentionally. Here’s a concrete, step‑by‑step plan with few yet clear steps:

------------------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Setup and Registration  
   • Create the IdenticalExprChecker and register it for AST code body checking.  
   • In your checker’s checkASTCodeBody method, instantiate your RecursiveASTVisitor (e.g., FindIdenticalExprVisitor) by passing it:  
  – The BugReporter for emitting diagnostic messages  
  – A pointer to your checker (to use in reports)  
  – The AnalysisDeclContext (which provides AST Source Manager and context)  
   • Call the visitor’s TraverseDecl method on the provided Decl to run your analysis.

2. Implement the Visitor (FindIdenticalExprVisitor)  
   • Derive your visitor class from RecursiveASTVisitor.  
   • Override VisitBinaryOperator to detect identical expressions used with binary operators.  
  – In VisitBinaryOperator, check if the operator is bitwise, logical, or a comparison operator (using BinaryOperator::isBitwiseOp, isLogicalOp, and isComparisonOp).  
  – For bitwise/logical operators, traverse the left-hand side chain (if the same operator appears more than once) so that you compare the right-hand side with deeper left-hand operands.  
  – Use your helper function isIdenticalStmt to compare the two sides.  
  – If they are identical, call a helper (e.g., reportIdenticalExpr) that retrieves the operator’s location and emits a bug report with an appropriate message.

   • Override VisitIfStmt to catch duplicate conditions in nested if-statements or chained conditions.  
  – For example, if an outer if’s condition is exactly the same as an inner if’s condition, report it.  
  – Also, if both the “then” and “else” branches (after unwrapping a compound statement if necessary) are identical, warn the user.

   • Override VisitConditionalOperator to catch cases where the *true* and *false* expressions are identical.  
  – Again, use isIdenticalStmt for comparing the two expressions.  
  – If they are identical, emit a report with clear source location (using conditional operator colon location).

3. Comparison with isIdenticalStmt  
   • Use the helper function isIdenticalStmt (which compares the AST subtrees of two expressions) to decide if two expressions or statements are identical.  
   • This function should ignore irrelevant details like side effects or macro locations if required.  
   • In the case of floating-point expressions, apply the special rules (e.g. for ==/!= versus < or >) to avoid false reports.

4. Reporting Bugs  
   • In every case when you detect identical expressions (whether in binary operators, if-statements, or conditional operators), invoke your BugReporter’s EmitBasicReport.  
   • Include a clear message for each case (e.g., “identical expressions on both sides of bitwise operator” or “identical conditions in if-statement”) along with the source location information extracted from the operator’s or condition’s SourceRange.  
   • For binary operators, collect the SourceRanges of the matching expressions for clarity.

5. Final Registration and Checker Details  
   • Ensure that you register your checker in the registration function (e.g., ento::registerIdenticalExprChecker) so that the Clang Static Analyzer can run it.  
   • Also implement ento::shouldRegisterIdenticalExprChecker to control the registration.

------------------------------------------------------------
By following these concrete steps, your checker will traverse all relevant AST nodes, compare subexpressions using the helper function, and emit a clear report when an expression appears identically in two places where it may be unintended. This is the simplest yet detailed approach to write a correct Identical Expression Checker in Clang Static Analyzer.
