Your goal is to trace how the checker “observes” the CFG traversal rather than detecting an error. This checker simply prints informational messages to llvm::outs() at key moments during analysis. Here is a step‐by‐step plan:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Track Function Boundaries  
   - In the checkBeginFunction callback, print a marker (for example, “--BEGIN FUNCTION--”) to indicate that the analyzer has entered a new function.  
   - In the checkEndFunction callback, print a marker (for example, “--END FUNCTION--”) to indicate that the analyzer is finishing the current function (triggered by a return statement).

2. Log Branch Conditions  
   - In checkBranchCondition, identify the condition’s context.  
     • First, try to detect if the condition is part of an Objective‑C for‑in loop (using ObjCForCollectionStmt).  
     • Otherwise, obtain the enclosing statement by looking at the ParentMap.  
   - Retrieve the source location (the beginning of the statement) and print the line number along with the statement’s class name.  
   - This helps you see which branches (if conditions, loops, etc.) are encountered during CFG traversal.

3. Dump Call Events (Pre-Call)  
   - In the checkPreCall callback, compute an indentation level based on the depth of the current LocationContext.  
   - Print the call’s details (using Call.dump(llvm::outs())) so you can see the function call details before it is executed.  
   - This logging assists you in understanding the call stack and how function invocations are traversed.

4. Dump Call Events (Post-Call)  
   - In the checkPostCall callback, again compute an indentation level based on the current LocationContext depth.  
   - Retrieve the call expression (if available) and check if the function’s return type is void.  
     • If the return type is void, print “Returning void”.  
     • Otherwise, print the value returned by the call (by printing C.getSVal(CallE)).  
   - These printed details let you follow the result of each call as the analyzer builds the ExplodedGraph.

5. Registration of the Checkers  
   - The two checkers are registered separately.  
     • The first one (TraversalDumper) registers itself for check::BranchCondition, check::BeginFunction, and check::EndFunction.  
     • The second one (CallDumper) registers for check::PreCall and check::PostCall.  
   - This registration ensures that during analysis, Clang Static Analyzer will invoke these callbacks at the appropriate points.

------------------------------------------------------------

Each step is concrete and only prints messages via llvm::outs(). This makes your checker simple to implement and helps you follow the control flow and function traversal of the analyzer. Once you set up these callbacks, you will see detailed tracing output that reflects the CFG traversal through branch conditions, function boundaries, and call events.
