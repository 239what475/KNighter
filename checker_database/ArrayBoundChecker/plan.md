Your plan is as follows:

1. Register for the Location event:
   • The checker listens for memory load/store events via the check::Location callback.

2. Identify element accesses:
   • In checkLocation, obtain the memory region from the passed SVal.
   • Ensure the region is an ElementRegion (which represents an array element access). If not, ignore the event.

3. Extract the index used for the array access:
   • Retrieve the element index from the ElementRegion as a DefinedOrUnknownSVal.
   • If the index is a known zero constant (which is always safe), simply return without further action.

4. Determine the array bounds:
   • Use getDynamicElementCount() with the ElementRegion’s super region and the element type to obtain the total number of elements in the array.
   • This function accounts for run-time size information.

5. Check index against the array size:
   • Use the program state method assumeInBoundDual() with the index and element count. This will yield two possible states: one where the index is in-bound (StInBound) and one where it is out-of-bound (StOutBound).
   • If you can prove that the index is out-of-bound (StOutBound exists) and not in-bound (StInBound does not exist), then this access is unsafe.

6. Report the bug:
   • Generate an error node for the out-of-bound case.
   • Create and populate a PathSensitiveBugReport with a clear message ("Access out-of-bound array element (buffer overflow)").
   • Use the source range from the load statement to highlight the error.
   • Emit the report so that the analyzer later presents it to the user.

7. Transition the state:
   • If the index is in-bound, update the state by transitioning to StInBound. This helps avoid duplicate warnings along different paths.

This plan outlines the simple steps needed to detect and report an out-of-bound array element access in the ArrayBoundChecker.
