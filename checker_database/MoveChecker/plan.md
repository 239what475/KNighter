Your detection plan for the MoveChecker can be broken down into a few clear concrete steps. In essence, the checker tracks when an object is “moved‐from” by updating the program state (using a map) and then later flags any use that might misuse that moved-from object. Here’s a simple, step‐by‐step plan outlining the key actions:

--------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Track Object States with a Program State Map  
   • Use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE (TrackedRegionMap) to keep a mapping from each object’s memory region (MemRegion) to a RegionState.  
   • The RegionState has two concrete states: “Moved” (object has been moved from) or “Reported” (a bug was already reported for that region).  
   • This state tracking is the foundation; every time an object’s state changes, update this map.

2. Detect Moves in Post-Call Callbacks  
   • In the checkPostCall callback, inspect each function call that might change an object’s state.  
   • For constructor calls (specifically move constructors) or move assignment operators, identify the “this” or argument region.  
   • Check that the call is indeed a move operation (e.g. using isMoveConstructor() or isMoveAssignmentOperator()).  
   • For a valid move, mark the memory region (object) in the program state as moved using RegionState::getMoved().  
   • This state update happens only if the object is eligible (for example, the object must be local and not a temporary object).

3. Report Misuse in Pre-Call Callbacks  
   • In checkPreCall, before a method call is made, inspect the object on which the method is being invoked (usually the “this” pointer).  
   • For several kinds of calls (copy constructors, assignment calls, overloaded operators, and regular member calls) check if the object has been flagged as moved in the TrackedRegionMap.  
   • Also, call helper functions (e.g. modelUse) that classify the object (using its type or whether it is a local variable / smart pointer) to decide if it should be tracked further.  
   • If a moved-from object is used (for example, the object is dereferenced, or its method is called when it is in a moved state), trigger a report by generating a non-fatal error node or an error node (especially if the misuse can lead to a crash, such as dereferencing a null smart pointer).  
   • The bug message is built with extra context (using a visitor like MovedBugVisitor) that pinpoints where the object was moved.

4. Clean Up and Update State When Objects Become Dead  
   • In the checkDeadSymbols callback, iterate through all regions stored in the TrackedRegionMap and remove those that are no longer live.  
   • This makes sure that stale state does not linger in the map.

5. Update State on Region Changes (e.g., Invalidation)  
   • In the checkRegionChanges callback, update (or remove) entries from the TrackedRegionMap when objects’ regions are invalidated—for instance, because of write operations or pointer re-binding.  
   • This ensures that once an object’s memory is reused or the object is otherwise altered, the checker’s state remains accurate.

--------------------------------------------------
Each step is deliberately simple and concrete:

• The state map is the core; it tracks if an object has been moved.  
• The post-call callback flags moves and updates the state.  
• The pre-call callback uses this state to determine whether an operation on the object is illegal (or potentially causing undefined behavior).  
• Finally, cleanup callbacks (dead symbol and region changes) keep the program state consistent.

By following these steps, you can write a correct checker that accurately detects any use-after-move scenarios and emits warnings when an object in a moved-from (or reported) state is misused.
