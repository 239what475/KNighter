Your plan here
----------------
1. Identify run loop launch and message activities:
   • Use AST matchers to capture the NSRunLoop “mainRunLoop” and “run” calls.  
   • Bind these calls to identifiers (RunLoopBind and RunLoopRunBind).  
   • Capture any ObjC message expressions that allocate temporary autoreleased objects using a separate matcher bound as OtherMsgBind.

2. Match autorelease pool usage:
   • Use an AST matcher to detect if the NSRunLoop run call and the temporary object allocations happen inside an ObjC autorelease pool (binding to AutoreleasePoolBind).  
   • Also match temporary objects sent in an autorelease pool with a distinct binding (OtherStmtAutoreleasePoolBind).

3. Differentiate between two scenarios:
   • In one case, both the temporary objects and the run loop call occur in the same autorelease pool.  
   • In the other, the run loop (or xpc_main) is launched without any autorelease pool.

4. Determine the evaluation order:
   • Create a helper (seenBefore) to roughly decide if the run loop call happens before or after the message call.  
   • If the run loop is evaluated before the temporary object allocation, ignore it; otherwise, a potential leak exists.

5. Emit a diagnostic if a leak is detected:
   • Use the emitDiagnostics function to build and report an error message that suggests temporary objects might never be released because they remain in an autorelease pool that is discarded only at program exit.

6. Run the analysis:
   • In the checkASTCodeBody callback, invoke two separate matching routines: one for code inside an autorelease pool and one for code without any autorelease pool.  
   • For each match, if conditions indicate the temporary object allocation is “too late” (i.e., after the run loop starts or no proper pool is present), report a memory leak warning.

Each step is concrete and directly maps to a distinct part of the checker’s design, ensuring the solution remains simple while covering all necessary detection concerns.
