Your detection plan can be broken down into a few clear, concrete steps. Each step describes what the checker does to find potential mismatches between the casted type (of the malloc/calloc/realloc call) and the type used in the sizeof expression inside its argument(s).

Plan

1. Traverse the Function’s AST Body  
   • In the checker’s main callback (checkASTCodeBody), the checker inspects the entire body of the function being analyzed.  
   • An instance of CastedAllocFinder is created to visit all statements in the function’s AST.  
   • This visitor is responsible for finding candidate expressions where an allocation call is cast to a pointer.

2. Find Casting Patterns for Allocation Calls  
   • The CastedAllocFinder uses the visitor pattern to walk the AST.  
   • It specifically looks for cast expressions (either explicit or implicit) that wrap a call to malloc, calloc, or realloc.  
   • When it detects such a cast, it collects a record that includes:  
  – The parent expression (or variable declaration) where the cast occurs.  
  – The casted expression and its corresponding explicit cast type (if available).  
  – The allocation call itself.

3. Examine Allocation Call Arguments for sizeof Usage  
   • For every cast record, iterate over the arguments passed to the allocation call.  
   • Only consider arguments whose type is integral (or an unscoped enumeration).  
   • For each such argument, utilize a secondary visitor (SizeofFinder) to search for any sizeof expressions.  
   • The SizeofFinder records all sizeof expressions encountered in these arguments.

4. Validate the Cast Type Against the sizeof Operand Type  
   • From the cast record, extract the pointer type (the type after casting the result of the allocation call).  
   • Determine the pointee type (what the pointer is expected to point to).  
   • Ensure that there is exactly one sizeof expression found in the allocation call’s arguments (this ensures a clear match is attempted).  
   • Retrieve the type of the operand used inside the sizeof expression.  
   • Using the helper function (typesCompatible), compare the pointee type with the sizeof operand’s type.  
  – This function performs a canonical comparison (ignoring const differences) and even handles some pointer versus void* special cases.  
  – If the types are not directly compatible, a secondary check (compatibleWithArrayType) is used to cover array types that might be implicitly accepted.

5. Report a Mismatch Error  
   • If the pointer’s pointee type does not match the type used in the sizeof operand (neither directly nor via array compatibility), then prepare an error report.  
   • Construct a diagnostic message that details which allocator (malloc, calloc, or realloc) was called and why the types are incompatible.  
   • Highlight source ranges including:  
  – The call’s callee source range (for the allocator function),  
  – The source range of the sizeof expression, and  
  – The range for the explicit cast (if available).  
   • Emit this report so that the developer is warned about a potential programmer error with the memory allocation.

By following these concrete steps—from AST traversal to type compatibility checks and finally reporting—the checker efficiently detects inconsistencies between the casted type of allocation calls and the corresponding sizeof operand type.
