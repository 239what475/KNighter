Below is one concrete way to think about how the DeadStoresChecker “works” by listing its detection plan in roughly eight steps. Follow these steps to understand or re‐implement the checker:

1. Build the CFG and Prepare Analysis Data:
   • During AST body checking (in checkASTCodeBody), the checker gets the control‐flow graph (CFG) for the current function (skipping template instantiations).
   • It then obtains the analysis context (including ParentMap) and runs a LiveVariables analysis on the CFG.
   • A helper visitor (FindEscaped) walks through the CFG to record any variables whose address is taken (i.e. “escaped” variables). These will be excluded from dead store warnings later.

2. Create an Observer for Live Variables:
   • The checker instantiates an observer (DeadStoreObs) that inherits from LiveVariables::Observer.
   • This observer is passed the CFG, ASTContext, BugReporter, analysis context, parent map, and the set of escaped VarDecls.
   • The observer is responsible for inspecting each statement in the CFG.

3. Traverse Each CFG Block and Statement:
   • The LiveVariables analysis calls the observer’s observeStmt method on every statement in each CFG block.
   • The observer saves the current block and ignores statements from macros. It also skips assignments that do not meet expected patterns (for instance, non-assignment statements).

4. Check Assignment Statements:
   • When an assignment (via BinaryOperator) is encountered, the observer first checks if the left-hand side is a DeclRefExpr referring to a local variable.
   • It then “looks through” nested assignments or comma operators to reach the actual stored value.
   • The observer determines what kind of assignment is being done. For example, distinguishing between a regular assignment (“Standard”), a nested assignment in a larger expression (“Enclosing”), or an increment (“DeadIncrement”). Initialization (DeadInit) is also handled separately.

5. Consult LiveVariables Data:
   • For every assignment, the observer uses the LiveVariables analysis (via LiveVariables::LivenessValues) to verify if the variable is live after that store.
   • If the variable is not “live” (that is, there is no subsequent read of its value) and it does not have attributes that would disable the warning (for example, if it is marked Unused or has lifetime attributes), it becomes a candidate for a dead store warning.
   • In addition, if the variable appears in exception-handling (EH) code (as recorded by an EHCodeVisitor) it is treated as always live and is skipped.

6. Check Special Cases:
   • The observer takes care not to issue warnings for self-assignments or for defensive programming patterns such as assigning a null pointer to a pointer.
   • It also avoids warnings on volatile variables or initializations that involve constants (unless the initialization is genuinely “dead”).
   • In the case of assignments within unreachable CFG blocks (computed by the ReachableCode helper), the warning will be suppressed.

7. Report the Dead Store:
   • When a dead store is found (for example, “Value stored to ‘var’ is never read”), the observer calls a Report() helper.
   • The Report() method formats a bug report with the appropriate title (e.g., “Dead assignment” or “Dead increment”) and message that explains the variable is assigned a value that is never subsequently used.
   • Optionally, if the checker is configured to show fix-its, the Report() method may suggest a removal of the unnecessary assignment.

8. Emit the Bug Report:
   • The DeadStoresChecker is registered with the analyzer via checkASTCodeBody.
   • After the observer has visited all CFG blocks, any reported bugs (dead stores) are emitted via the BugReporter.
   • This completes the flow-sensitive detection of stores to dead variables.

By following these concrete steps, you can re-create or trace through the DeadStoresChecker detection plan:
 – (a) Build your CFG and live variable information.
 – (b) Walk the CFG with an observer that inspects every assignment.
 – (c) Check liveness of each variable on every assignment.
 – (d) If a variable is found “dead” (unused after the store), report it along with a message (and possibly fix-its).

This step-by-step plan should help you write a checker that accurately detects stores to variables whose values are never read later in the program.
