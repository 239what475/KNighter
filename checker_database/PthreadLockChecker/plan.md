Your checker works by “simulating” the life‐cycle of a lock in the program state and then reporting errors when the simulated state is inconsistent with proper lock usage. Here’s a concrete, step‐by‐step plan that explains in simple terms how the detection works:

--------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Tracking Lock State

   • Define program state maps to keep track of where each lock is (using its memory region) and in what state it is.
     – A LockMap stores each lock’s state (e.g. Locked, Unlocked, Destroyed, etc.).
     – A LockSet keeps a (stack) list of locks (their mem regions) in the order they were acquired, which later helps detect lock order reversal.
     – A DestroyRetVal map is created to temporarily hold the symbol returned by a destroy call so the actual outcome can be resolved later.

2. Handling Function Calls via CallDescriptionMap

   • Use several CallDescriptionMap instances for the three APIs (Pthread, Fuchsia, C11). In each map the key is a function name (and expected argument count) and the value is a pointer to the corresponding handler method.

   • Examples:
     – When an initialization function (like pthread_mutex_init) is called, the InitAnyLock handler is invoked.
       * This updates the LockMap to mark the lock as “Unlocked.”
       * It adds the lock to the LockSet.
     – When an acquire function (like pthread_mutex_lock or trylock versions) is called, the AcquireLockAux method is invoked.
       * It first checks the current state of the given lock region.
       * If the lock is already in the "Locked" state (or already destroyed) then it reports an error (e.g. “Double locking”).
       * In the success case, it marks the lock as Locked in LockMap and pushes it onto the LockSet.
     – When an unlock call is detected (pthread_mutex_unlock, for example), the ReleaseLockAux handler:
       * Checks if the lock is currently not locked (or already unlocked/destroyed).
       * It also compares the unlocking region with the head of the LockSet to flag wrong lock order (lock order reversal).
       * Finally, it sets the lock state to Unlocked in the LockMap.
     – For destroy functions, the DestroyLockAux method:
       * Checks whether the lock is unlocked (or if it is still locked, it flags a bug).
       * For certain semantics (like with pthread_mutex_destroy), it defers the final state determination until the return value is known from the call. That symbol is stored in DestroyRetVal and later resolved.

3. Updating Program States and Transitions

   • Each handler (for init, acquire, release, destroy) updates the ProgramStateRef to reflect the new state.
   • Transitions are added using C.addTransition(State) so that the analyzer explores the new state.

4. Resolving "Possibly Destroyed" Locks

   • The function resolvePossiblyDestroyedMutex is used when a lock destruction call may—in the short period before the return value is checked—leave the lock in an ambiguous state.
   • When the checker sees that the symbol (from DestroyRetVal) dies or is revisited (in checkDeadSymbols), this function uses constraints (whether the return value equals zero) to decide if the lock should be marked as “Destroyed” or reverted back to unlocked.

5. Cleaning Up and Error Reporting

   • In the checkDeadSymbols callback, the checker cleans up the state:
     – It removes entries for locks whose memory regions are no longer live.
     – It also removes entries from DestroyRetVal once the outcome has been resolved.
   • The reportBug helper function is then used in each handler to emit a clear message when an error is detected (for example, double locking, double unlocking, lock use after destruction, or lock order reversal).

6. Debug and State Printing

   • A printState function is provided for debugging; it dumps the current LockMap and LockSet contents to help visualize the lock states during analysis.

--------------------------------------------------
By following this plan, the checker “simulates” the locking operations at runtime (from the perspective of static analysis), updates its internal state, and then reports bugs when the actual usage (as inspected during later call events) conflicts with expected ordering or state transitions.

Each step is concrete:
– Define and update state (using maps for LockMap, LockSet, and DestroyRetVal).
– Handle each lock-related function (init, lock, try-lock, unlock, and destroy) by mapping from the function’s call event to proper state manipulation.
– Report errors immediately when the simulated state contradicts the expected behavior.

This step-by-step plan is fairly minimal and concrete to help you implement or understand a correct checker for locking issues.
