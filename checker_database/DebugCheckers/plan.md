Plan

1. Initialization and Header Inclusion  
   • Include the necessary Clang Static Analyzer and LLVM headers for building CFGs, call graphs, dominator trees, live-variable analyses, and handling exploded graphs.  
   • These headers provide the APIs needed for inspecting and printing internal analysis structures.

2. Define Debugging Checkers  
   • Create several checker classes specializing in different debugging tasks. Each class derives from Checker with the appropriate callback types (e.g., ASTCodeBody, EndAnalysis, or ASTDecl).  
   • For each checker, override the callback method where the analysis information will be computed and dumped.

3. Build and Dump Analyses  
   • DominatorsTreeDumper  
     - In the checkASTCodeBody callback, obtain the AnalysisDeclContext for the declaration.  
     - Build the dominator tree from the CFG using CFGDomTree::buildDominatorTree.  
     - Dump the tree to the standard output.  
     
   • PostDominatorsTreeDumper  
     - Similarly, build the post-dominator tree from the CFG and dump it.
     
   • ControlDependencyTreeDumper  
     - Create a ControlDependencyCalculator from the CFG and invoke its dump method.
     
   • LiveVariablesDumper and LiveExpressionsDumper  
     - Retrieve LiveVariables (or RelaxedLiveVariables) analysis data from the manager.  
     - Call the appropriate dump method to print live variable or expression liveness.
     
   • CFGViewer and CFGDumper  
     - For the current Decl, retrieve the CFG.  
     - Either display the CFG graphically (CFGViewer) or dump the CFG details (CFGDumper) using provided language options.
     
   • CallGraphViewer and CallGraphDumper  
     - From the Translation Unit declaration, build the CallGraph.  
     - View or dump the call graph structure.
     
   • ConfigDumper  
     - At the end of the translation unit, iterate over the AnalyzerOptions configuration table.  
     - Sort and dump each configuration option’s key and value.
     
   • ExplodedGraphViewer  
     - At the end of the analysis, obtain the ExplodedGraph and call the viewer on it.
     
   • ReportStmts  
     - In the PreStmt callback for every statement, generate a nonfatal error node and emit a simple bug report indicating that a statement was visited.  
     - This checker is intended purely for debugging, highlighting each statement processed by the analyzer.

4. Registration  
   • For each checker, implement its corresponding registration function (e.g., registerDominatorsTreeDumper, registerCFGViewer, etc.).  
   • Each registration function calls mgr.registerChecker<CheckerClass>() to add the checker to the CheckerManager.  
   • Also provide a simple predicate (e.g., shouldRegisterDominatorsTreeDumper) that always returns true. This ensures that the debugging checkers are available when requested.

5. Execution Flow  
   • When the analyzer runs over a translation unit, these debugging checkers activate at various stages:  
     - ASTCodeBody checkers run on the bodies of functions or methods, dumping CFG and dominator information.  
     - EndOfTranslationUnit or EndAnalysis checkers run after the entire translation unit has been processed to dump config and call graph data.  
     - PreStmt checkers run on every visited statement to report its location, aiding in contextual debugging.  
   • The printed output (e.g., dominator trees, CFGs, call graphs, live variable information) assists developers in understanding how the analyzer is interpreting the code's control flow and data flow.

Summary:  
This checker suite is designed purely for debugging purposes. Each checker collects and displays specific internal analysis structures (CFGs, dominator trees, call graphs, etc.) during different phases of static analysis. They are registered with the analysis manager and, upon execution, dump internal state information to help developers inspect and debug the analyzer's behavior.

By keeping the steps simple—fetching the analysis data structures, processing them (e.g., sorting config entries, dumping tree structures), and using a dedicated callback to print/save output—the checker provides clear insight into the static analyzer's inner workings while remaining easy to follow and extend.
