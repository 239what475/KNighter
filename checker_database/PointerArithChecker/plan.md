Your task is to flag pointer arithmetic that is applied to regions not guaranteed to be arrays and warn specifically when the pointer arithmetic might lead to dangerous behavior (for example, when using a base‐class pointer that has been “polymorphically” converted). One way to do this is to combine information about what was allocated with how its pointer is later used. Here’s a simple, step‑by‑step plan outlining the checker’s detection process:

────────────────────────────
Plan

1. Initialize and Record Allocation Information
   • Define a program state map (RegionState) mapping a memory region to an allocation kind (AllocKind). The enum AllocKind holds values such as SingleObject, Array, Unknown, and Reinterpreted.
   • In the (post‑statement) callback for a new operator (CXXNewExpr), determine if the allocation is for an array or a single object by calling getKindOfNewOp. Then store the result in the state.
   • In the post‑stmt callback for CallExpr (i.e. C allocation functions such as malloc, calloc, etc.), check whether the called function is one of a pre‑initialized set (e.g. alloca, malloc, realloc, calloc, valloc). If so, assume the returned memory is an array (or, at least, record it as such) in the RegionState map.

2. Detect Changes via Casts
   • In the pre‑statement callback for CastExpr (when the cast is an ArrayToPointerDecay), look up the underlying region. If there is no explicit information yet in the RegionState, mark its state as Array.
   • In the post‑statement callback for CastExpr (for bit casts), record the region as having been reinterpreted (AllocKind::Reinterpreted). This helps suppress false positives when pointer arithmetic is applied on these regions.

3. Reporting Pointer Arithmetic Misuse
   • For pointer arithmetic on non‑array objects, use callbacks for various statement types:
       – In checkPreStmt for UnaryOperator: detect increment/decrement operations on pointer types. Use reportPointerArithMisuse (with the option to “look” at the pointed region) to see if arithmetic is dangerous.
       – In checkPreStmt for BinaryOperator: when a pointer is added to or subtracted by an integer value (or vice versa), retrieve the LHS pointer’s memory region. Also cover assignment forms (like += or -=). Make sure you do not warn if the arithmetic involves null pointers.
       – In checkPreStmt for ArraySubscriptExpr: if the index is non‑zero (or the base pointer is not of a vector type), then check the base pointer’s memory region.

4. Using Region Information to Warn
   • In the helper function (reportPointerArithMisuse), retrieve the base (or “pointed”) region from the expression.
   • Then, call getArrayRegion on this region:
       – If the region is determined to be an array (or at least “symbolic” enough to assume an array) and a polymorphic conversion is involved (for example, if a base class pointer was derived from a different type), then issue a specialized bug report (using the BT_polyArray bug type).
       – Otherwise, if the region is marked as a SingleObject or is unknown (and the arithmetic does not appear to be safe), then report a warning with the BT_pointerArith bug type. In other words, flag pointer arithmetic on regions that are not arrays.
   • Mark the reported memory region as “interesting” in the bug report so that users can easily see which memory area is problematic.

5. Clean-up (Optional)
   • (In checkDeadSymbols) Remove stale state information by checking for dead memory regions so that the state map does not grow indefinitely.

────────────────────────────
Following this plan, your checker:
   – Records information about how memory is allocated and whether a pointer points to an array.
   – Watches for casts that might change the pointer’s interpretation.
   – Catches pointer arithmetic operations (via unary, binary, and array subscript expressions) that are applied on pointers that might reference non‑array memory.
   – Issues a warning when dangerous pointer arithmetic is performed—especially on pointers that might point to base class subobjects (polymorphic pointers) or non‑array data.

This streamlined plan gives you a concrete way to replicate the Checker’s behavior using a few simple, clear steps.
