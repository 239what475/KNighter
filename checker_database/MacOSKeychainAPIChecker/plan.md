Your plan here

1. Setup State Tracking and Data Structures  
   • Define a ProgramState map (AllocatedData) to track allocated pointers.  
   • Create an AllocationState structure that holds the allocator function index and the allocated region’s symbol.  
   • This state is used to know which allocated data has not yet been freed.

2. Define the API Functions to Track  
   • Prepare a static list (ADFunctionInfo) that lists all the allocator and deallocator functions the checker cares about.  
     – Allocators include functions like SecKeychainItemCopyContent, SecKeychainFindGenericPassword, SecKeychainFindInternetPassword, and SecKeychainItemCopyAttributesAndData.  
     – Deallocator functions include SecKeychainItemFreeContent and SecKeychainItemFreeAttributesAndData.  
     – Also track “error” or “possible” APIs such as free or CFStringCreateWithBytesNoCopy.  
   • Use a helper (getTrackedFunctionIndex) that, given a function name and a flag (allocator vs. deallocator), returns an index if the function is one of the tracked ones.

3. Pre-Statement Analysis (checkPreStmt Callback)  
   • When a call is about to be executed (in checkPreStmt), first determine the function name.  
   • If it is an allocator call:  
     – Extract the pointer argument (via getAsPointeeSymbol) and check whether it is already present in the AllocatedData map.  
     – If the symbol is already tracked, this indicates a previous allocation was not freed.  
     – Remove the symbol from the state and report an error showing the missing deallocation (using a bug report with a helpful message).  
   • If it is a deallocator call:  
     – Retrieve the appropriate pointer argument and check whether it is in the AllocatedData map.  
     – Validate that the pointer’s type is acceptable (i.e. not coming from a bad source like an alloca).  
     – If a tracker AllocationState exists, verify that the deallocator being used matches the expected one (using the stored allocator index).  
     – If there’s a mismatch, generate a deallocator mismatch report; otherwise, remove the allocation’s entry from the state.

4. Post-Statement Analysis (checkPostStmt Callback)  
   • After a call is executed, if it is an allocator call:  
     – Retrieve the allocation parameter (the pointer argument) that holds the memory being allocated.  
     – Capture the symbol for that allocated memory.  
     – Update the AllocatedData state by mapping the symbol to a new AllocationState (which stores the function index and the return status symbol).  
     – This binding makes sure that subsequent deallocations can be matched to the proper allocation site.

5. Handling Memory Leaks (checkDeadSymbols Callback)  
   • When symbols become “dead” (i.e. go out-of-scope), iterate over the AllocatedData map.  
   • If any tracked allocation is no longer live and was not freed, that indicates a leak.  
   • Emit a bug report (using generateAllocatedDataNotReleasedReport) for each leaked allocation and remove it from the state.

6. Additional State Management  
   • Pointer Escape (checkPointerEscape): If a tracked symbol escapes (for example, by being passed to a function that may not preserve our tracking), remove it from AllocatedData so that we do not falsely report an error later.  
   • Assumptions (evalAssume): If analysis assumptions indicate that an error status was returned (i.e. allocation failure), remove the allocation info from the state.

7. Diagnostic Reporting and Visitor Support  
   • Use generateDeallocatorMismatchReport to issue a clear warning when a deallocator mismatches the allocation method (for example, if SecKeychainItemFreeContent is not used when needed).  
   • Use generateAllocatedDataNotReleasedReport to report missing frees (leaks) with a message that suggests the proper deallocator function.  
   • A custom BugVisitor (SecKeychainBugVisitor) is provided to walk the explosive graph and report the allocation site for extra diagnostic detail.

8. Debug Support  
   • Implement printState to allow developers to see the current AllocatedData state, aiding in debugger output and internal state checks during the analysis.

This plan ensures the checker:
– Tracks all keychain API allocations by recording pointers and their allocation sites.
– Detects double allocations and deallocator mismatches by checking the state in pre-statement callbacks.
– Reports missing deallocation (memory leaks) when Symbols go dead.
– Provides detailed diagnostics (via bug reports and visitors) to help pinpoint the source of bugs associated with improper SecKeychain API usage.
