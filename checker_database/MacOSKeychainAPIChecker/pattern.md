## Bug Pattern

Memory allocated via Keychain API functions (e.g. SecKeychainItemCopyContent, SecKeychainFindGenericPassword, SecKeychainFindInternetPassword, etc.) is expected to be released with a specific corresponding deallocation function (e.g. SecKeychainItemFreeContent). The bug pattern occurs when the allocated memory is not freed using the correct deallocatorâ€”or when an incorrect, mismatched deallocation function is used (such as free or another non-corresponding API call). This improper pairing of allocation and deallocation leads to resource leaks or deallocator mismatch errors.
