Your plan for the NSErrorChecker “detection” consists of a few concrete steps that are separated by checker responsibility. Each step below explains exactly what to do:

------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Check Objective-C Methods (NSErrorMethodChecker)
------------------------------------------------------
• When an ObjC method declaration (ObjCMethodDecl) is encountered, first verify that the declaration is a definition.
• Then, check that the method’s return type is void.
• Iterate over the method’s parameters and identify if any parameter is of type NSError**. (Use an Identifier for "NSError" and a helper function such as IsNSError to do this.)
• If such a parameter is found, immediately emit a bug report with a clear error message such as:
  "Method accepting NSError** should have a non-void return value to indicate whether or not an error occurred".
• Use the BugReporter’s BR.EmitBasicReport to report this problem.

------------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Check C Functions (CFErrorFunctionChecker)
------------------------------------------------------
• For every function definition (FunctionDecl) that is encountered (make sure it has a body), check if its return type is void.
• Skip any functions with reserved return types (e.g., constructors or delete operators) by using a helper function (like hasReservedReturnType).
• Iterate over the function’s parameters and check if any parameter is of type CFErrorRef* (again, compare using an Identifier for "CFErrorRef" and a helper function like IsCFError).
• If a parameter with CFErrorRef* is found, report a bug through BR.EmitBasicReport with a message explaining that:
  "Function accepting CFErrorRef* should have a non-void return value to indicate whether or not an error occurred".

------------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Track Pointer Usage for Error-Out Parameters (NSOrCFErrorDerefChecker – checkLocation)
------------------------------------------------------
• In the checkLocation callback, intercept memory load events (when isLoad is true) and ignore non-load accesses.
• Retrieve the location’s SVal (if it is not undefined and is a Loc).
• Determine the parameter type by obtaining the QualType associated with the memory region. (A helper like parameterTypeFromSVal is used to map the region back to the parameter type.)
• If the type is determined to be NSError** (using the IsNSError helper) or CFErrorRef* (using IsCFError), then tag the symbol by calling a helper function (setFlag) that attaches the “error-out” flag to the symbol in the program state.
• This tagging ensures that later, if the pointer is used in a context that might lead to a null dereference, it will be recognized.

------------------------------------------------------
Step 4. Report Implicit Null Dereferences (NSOrCFErrorDerefChecker – checkEvent)
------------------------------------------------------
• In the checkEvent callback, handle events of type ImplicitNullDerefEvent that indicate a write or dereference occurring on a pointer.
• If the event is not a load (i.e., it is a dereference or store) then retrieve the SVal associated with the event’s location and check whether it has been flagged previously as an error-out pointer (using our program state flags for NSErrorOut or CFErrorOut).
• If the flag is set (meaning the pointer comes from an error-out parameter that should be checked), create a detailed bug report.
• Prepare the diagnostic message (for example, “Potential null dereference. According to coding standards, the parameter may be null…”) and report it using the corresponding bug type (either NSErrorDerefBug or CFErrorDerefBug).
• Use BR.emitReport along with a newly generated PathSensitiveBugReport to emit the bug.

------------------------------------------------------
Step 5. Checker Registration and Setup
------------------------------------------------------
• Register the NSErrorMethodChecker and CFErrorFunctionChecker with the AnalysisManager using their public registration functions.  
• Also, register the NSOrCFErrorDerefChecker that handles both location-based flagging and null-dereference events.
• Make sure to set the appropriate flags in NSOrCFErrorDerefChecker (e.g., ShouldCheckNSError and ShouldCheckCFError) and pass along the current checker name for consistent bug reporting.

------------------------------------------------------
Summary
------------------------------------------------------
By following these five concrete steps:
1. You catch and report methods that violate return type conventions for NSError**.
2. You catch and report functions that violate return type conventions for CFErrorRef*.
3. You mark pointers (from parameters) that might later be dereferenced without proper validation.
4. You check at the point of dereference if these pointers are null, and if so, report a bug.
5. You integrate the checkers into the static analyzer.
  
This plan keeps the checker focused and modular. Each step is designed to be as simple and concrete as possible so that you can follow along and implement your checker correctly.
