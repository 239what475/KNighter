## Bug Pattern

The checker detects improper resource management of file streams, where a file opened via fopen is mishandled by either being closed more than once (double fclose) or never being closed at all (resource leak). The pattern is that after a resource is acquired (opened), its state is not correctly updated or verified before a subsequent operation (like another fclose or program termination), leading to dangerous operations on an invalid or leaked resource.
