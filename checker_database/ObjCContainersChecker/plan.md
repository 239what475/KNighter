Your checker implements bounds‐checking for Core Foundation arrays (CFArray) in a path‐sensitive way. The overall detection plan can be summarized in a few concrete steps:

--------------------------------------------------
Your plan here
--------------------------------------------------
1. State Tracking Setup
   • Create a program state map (ArraySizeMap) that maps an array’s symbol (SymbolRef) to its size (a DefinedSVal). This lets you recall, later on, the size of any CFArray that you saw during the analysis.

2. Record Array Size Information (Post-Call)
   • In the post-call callback (checkPostStmt), intercept calls like CFArrayCreate and CFArrayGetCount.
   • For CFArrayCreate: Extract the size argument (typically the third argument) and, after confirming it is defined, record the array symbol along with its size in ArraySizeMap.
   • For CFArrayGetCount: Similarly, treat the call’s return value as the array size, and update ArraySizeMap for the given array symbol.
   • Use the helper function addSizeInfo to bind this size information to the array symbol within the program state.

3. Validate Array Access (Pre-Call)
   • In the pre-call callback (checkPreStmt), intercept calls to CFArrayGetValueAtIndex.
   • Extract the array symbol from the first argument of this call. Using this symbol, retrieve the previously stored size from ArraySizeMap.
   • Then, extract the index argument (the second argument) and—if it is well defined—use the analyzer’s assumeInBoundDual method to determine whether the index is within the valid range [0, size – 1].
   • If the analysis shows that the index can be out of bounds, generate an error node and create a bug report detailing that “Index is out of bounds.”

4. Handling Pointer Escapes
   • In the checkPointerEscape callback, remove any array symbols from ArraySizeMap if they “escape.” When an array value escapes (for instance, if it becomes accessible outside your controlled environment), you can no longer reliably track its size, so you remove its entry from the map.

5. Optional Debugging: State Printing
   • Implement printState to output the contents of ArraySizeMap for debugging purposes. This method will list, for each tracked array symbol, its size which can help validate that your state tracking is correct during testing.

--------------------------------------------------
Using these steps, your checker leverages program state transitions to keep track of CFArray sizes and then checks any array access calls to ensure that the index used is within bounds. This concrete and incremental plan minimizes the number of steps while remaining clear enough for a straightforward implementation.
