Your checker’s detection plan can be broken down into a few simple, concrete steps. Here is a straightforward plan with each step explained:

--------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Initialize Bug Types and Register Callbacks  
   • Define two BugType instances—one for reporting a null pointer dereference and one for undefined pointer dereferences.  
   • Register the checker to participate in the following events:  
     – check::Location (to catch pointer loads/stores)  
     – check::Bind (to catch assignments, particularly to reference variables)  
     – EventDispatcher<ImplicitNullDerefEvent> (to dispatch events when an implicit null dereference is detected)

2. Analyze Pointer Dereference in checkLocation  
   • In checkLocation, take the passed SVal (the memory location being accessed) and first check whether it is undefined.  
     – If undefined, obtain the underlying dereference-causing expression and, unless suppressed (using suppressReport), call reportBug with the “Undefined Pointer Value” type.  
   • If the value is defined (or unknown), use ProgramState::assume to split the state into two possibilities: one where the location is null and one where it is not null.  
     – If the analysis shows that the pointer can only be null, immediately report a bug using the “Null Pointer” bug type.  
     – If the pointer can be either null or not, generate a “sink” node for the null state and dispatch an ImplicitNullDerefEvent.  
     – Finally, transition the state to the “not-null” state for future analysis.

3. Provide Detailed Bug Reporting (reportBug)  
   • When reporting, select a message based on whether the null value is explicit (only null state exists) or implicit (both null and non-null are possible).  
   • Collect source information (via AddDerefSource) for the dereference expression so that the bug report points to the actual source (e.g., variable name, member field, etc.).  
   • Create and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with all the gathered details.

4. Handle Bindings in checkBind  
   • In checkBind, check assignments where the left-hand side is a reference.  
   • If the value is defined, perform a similar state split using assume on the righthand side value.  
     – If the value is definitely null, report the bug directly.  
     – If it may be null, generate a sink node and dispatch the implicit null dereference event.  
   • Transition the state accordingly after processing the bind event.

5. (Optional) Suppress Spurious Reports  
   • Implement suppressReport to avoid false bug reports on memory using specific address spaces (typically reserved for special segments on x86 architectures).  
   • This function should check the type’s address space and, if it matches the suppressed spaces (or if a global flag is set), return true to skip reporting on that expression.

--------------------------------------------------

Each step is concrete:

• In checkLocation, you clearly split the state, check for “only null” versus “ambiguous,” and then call reportBug (passing in the precise Stmt derived from getDereferenceExpr).

• In checkBind, you similarly split and then report if the binding is to a reference that would embed a null value.

• The AddDerefSource function is used to include additional context (e.g., variable name or field info) in the bug message.

By following these concrete steps, you can implement a correct null dereference checker that reports bugs when a pointer is either definitely null or may be null at the time of dereference.
