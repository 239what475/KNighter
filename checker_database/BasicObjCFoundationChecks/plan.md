Below is one way to break down the checkers’ detection plan into simple, concrete steps. In our plan we treat each registered checker as a “unit” that looks for a specific misuse. You can follow each step to write a similar checker.

Your plan here

1. Initialization and Registration
   • Define one or more BugType objects to describe the kind of misuse you want to report (for example, “nil argument,” “CF API misuse,” “class message sent to a class,” etc.).
   • Register your checkers (e.g. NilArgChecker, CFNumberChecker, CFRetainReleaseChecker, ClassReleaseChecker, VariadicMethodTypeChecker, ObjCLoopChecker, ObjCNonNilReturnValueChecker) with the CheckerManager. This ensures that every checker callback (in PreObjCMessage, PostStmt, etc.) is called at the right time when traversing the AST or analyzing the program state.

2. Detecting Nil Arguments (NilArgChecker)
   • In the pre-ObjC message handler (checkPreObjCMessage):
       – Get the receiver’s interface and determine its Foundation class (NSArray, NSDictionary, NSString, …).
       – Use helper routines (like findKnownClass and GetReceiverInterfaceName) to decide which argument index should be non-nil for a given method.
       – Call a helper function (e.g. warnIfNilArg) that uses the program state (via getSVal and isNull) to determine if a message argument is known to be nil.
       – If nil is found, produce an error node and generate a PathSensitiveBugReport that includes the source range.
   • In your post-statement callbacks for literal expressions (ObjCArrayLiteral and ObjCDictionaryLiteral):
       – Iterate over each element (or each key/value) and use a helper (warnIfNilExpr) to check if the element is nil.
       – Report an error if a literal is created that contains nil.

3. Checking CFNumber API (CFNumberChecker)
   • In a pre-statement callback on call expressions (checkPreStmt):
       – Confirm that the call is to CFNumberCreate or CFNumberGetValue by comparing the callee’s identifier.
       – Extract the “theType” argument from the CF API call.
       – Convert that value into a concrete integer and use a helper (GetCFNumberSize) to map the expected CF number type to its bit width.
       – Retrieve the type of the value argument (third parameter) and use the ASTContext to check its bit width.
       – Compare the two sizes; if they are not equal, generate a nonfatal error node and produce a bug report with details about the size mismatch.

4. Checking for Null in CF Memory Management (CFRetainReleaseChecker)
   • In the pre-call callback:
       – Verify that the called function is one of CFRetain, CFRelease, CFMakeCollectable, or CFAutorelease.
       – Fetch the single argument (typically the CF object) and check using the program state whether it is null.
       – If the argument is known to be null, create an error node and report a bug; otherwise, update the state to reflect that the argument has been assumed non-null.

5. Detecting Incorrect Message Receiver (ClassReleaseChecker)
   • In the pre-ObjC message callback:
       – Check if the message selector is one of “release”, “retain”, “autorelease”, or “drain”.
       – Confirm whether the message is actually sent to a class (instead of an instance) – for example by checking that the receiver is not an instance message.
       – If the message is improperly directed at the class itself, generate a nonfatal error node and produce a bug report indicating that such messages should be sent to instances.

6. Checking Variadic Method Argument Types (VariadicMethodTypeChecker)
   • In the pre-ObjC message callback:
       – Determine if the message is a variadic method (for example, “arrayWithObjects:” or “dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:”) by checking both the method declaration (variadic flag) and the selector.
       – Skip the known arguments (and the final nil terminator), then iterate over the variadic arguments.
       – For each argument, check that its type is an Objective-C object pointer. Skip pointer constants and type annotations that are known to be Objective-C.
       – If a mismatched argument type is detected, generate a nonfatal error node and report a bug with a message describing the expected type.

7. Loop Modeling for Cocoa Collections (ObjCLoopChecker)
   • In the post-statement callback for ObjCForCollectionStmt:
       – Read the collection’s value from the statement and use helper functions (e.g. checkCollectionNonNil and checkElementNonNil) to assume that the collection and its elements are not nil.
       – Use program-state maps (ContainerCountMap and ContainerNonEmptyMap) to track the symbolic “count” of items in a collection.
       – At the end of the loop (when no more iterations are available) update the state to reflect that the collection is empty or nonempty.
   • In a pointer escape callback:
       – Remove invalidated container symbols from your state maps to ensure that the analysis remains sound.
   • In a dead-symbol callback:
       – Clean up state by erasing information for symbols that are no longer tracked.

8. Assuming Non-Nil Return Values (ObjCNonNilReturnValueChecker)
   • In the post-ObjC message callback (and also for some literal post-stmt callbacks):
       – For known selectors (such as objectAtIndex: or objectAtIndexedSubscript: on NSArray/NSOrderedSet or a call to [NSNull null]), take the return value’s AST expression.
       – Use a helper that enforces the assumption that the return value is non-null by updating the program state.
       – Add the new state transition so that subsequent checks can rely on the fact that the value is non-null.

Usage

• Write each checker as a small unit that registers its callbacks (pre-message, post-stmt, post-call).
• Use helper functions to compute properties (for example, the nullness of an expression or the expected bit width of a CFNumber type).
• Transition the program state (using C.addTransition) so that later analysis steps have up‐to‐date information.
• Emit a bug report immediately after a problematic state is detected by generating an error node and associating a source range (so the user easily sees which part of the code is problematic).

Following these concrete steps and mapping each responsibility (nil checking, CF type checking, etc.) directly to a small unit will keep the checker code simple and modular.
