## Bug Pattern

The checker looks for cases where foundation APIs are misused by passing nil where non‐nil objects are expected or by failing to verify that an API’s return value is non-nil before use. In essence, the bug pattern is: a value that must be validated (typically for non-nil) is used without the necessary null-check, leading to API misusage (such as by invoking methods on nil receivers, supplying nil for required key/value arguments in collection methods, or mismanaging memory via invalid CF calls). This pattern is common when developers assume that a method always returns a valid object or that a particular argument can be nil, potentially resulting in runtime crashes or undefined behavior.
