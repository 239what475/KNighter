Your plan can be summarized in a few concrete steps:

1. Intercept and Filter Cast Expressions  
 • Use a PreStmt callback for CastExpr so that every integer-to-enum cast gets inspected.  
 • Immediately filter out casts that are not of kind “integral cast” (i.e. using CK_IntegralCast) since only these are relevant.

2. Validate the Cast Target Type and Retrieve the Value  
 • Check if the cast’s target type is an enumeration using isEnumeralType(). If not, do nothing.  
 • Retrieve the SVal of the subexpression being cast. If you cannot produce a DefinedOrUnknownSVal from it, stop further processing.

3. Gather Valid Enumeration Values  
 • From the EnumDecl for the target type, collect all enumerator values.  
 • Store these values (for example, in a SmallVector) so you know the range of acceptable integer values.

4. Compare the Cast Value Against Enumeration Values  
 • For each enumerator value, use a constraint-based evaluator (such as the provided ConstraintBasedEQEvaluator) to check if the cast value could equal that enumerator’s value.  
 • Rely on the ConstraintManager so that you conservatively decide if any possible value match exists.

5. Report an Out-of-Range Cast if Needed  
 • If none of the valid enumerator comparisons are possibly true, generate a non-fatal error node.  
 • Create and configure a bug report that details the invalid cast (optionally including the concrete integer value if it’s available) and attach the source ranges for better diagnostics.  
 • Finally, emit the report with C.emitReport(…).

This simple, concrete sequence of steps will let you write a checker that intercepts enum casts, verifies the range by comparing against all valid enum constant values, and reports a potential bug when the cast value is out of range.
