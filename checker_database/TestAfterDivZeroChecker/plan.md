Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Register and Use a Program State Map

• Define a program‐state set (DivZeroMap) to record divisors that have been used in a division operation.  
• Each entry wraps a ZeroState that holds:
  – the symbol for the divisor,
  – the block ID where the division occurred, and
  – the stack frame context.  
This lets you later check if a value being compared to zero (in a branch) was already used as a divisor.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Track Divisor Use in Division Operations

• In the checkPreStmt callback (triggered for every BinaryOperator):  
  – Verify that the operator is one of the division or remainder kinds (e.g. BO_Div, BO_Rem, BO_DivAssign, BO_RemAssign).  
  – Get the right-hand-side (RHS) of the division (the divisor).  
  – Use the helper function isZero to determine whether the divisor is known to be zero.  
  – If the divisor is not statically known to be zero, record it in DivZeroMap by calling setDivZeroMap.  
This step “remembers” that a particular divisor symbol was used in a division before it was later compared to zero.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Detect a Later Comparison with Zero

• In the checkBranchCondition callback (which intercepts the evaluation of conditions in branches):  
  – Look for branch conditions that compare a value with zero.  
  – This examination includes various forms:
    – A BinaryOperator (like “if (x == 0)”) where one side is an integer literal 0.
    – A UnaryOperator (logical not, “if (!x)”) that implies a zero comparison.
    – Implicit cast expressions that wrap comparisons.
  – Extract the value being compared (the operand that is not the literal zero).  
  – Check if this value’s symbol exists in DivZeroMap.  
If found, this means the same value was previously used in a division before being checked against zero.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4. Report the Suspicious Pattern

• When a comparison is found against a value already recorded in DivZeroMap, call reportBug to signal a problem.  
  – In reportBug, generate an error (nonfatal) node and create a bug report with a clear message:  
    "Value being compared against zero has already been used for division".  
  – Attach a visitor (DivisionBRVisitor) to this report so that when the report is viewed, it will highlight the division operation (by examining the division’s RHS) where the reused value was employed.  
This diagnostic message informs the user that the value was already used as a divisor and is now being compared against zero.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5. Clean up State on Function Exit

• In checkEndFunction, remove any DivZeroMap entries related to the current stack frame.  
  – Iterate over the DivZeroMap and remove those entries whose ZeroState’s stack frame matches the current one.  
This ensures that the map does not leak state across function boundaries.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6. Use the DivisionBRVisitor for Additional Diagnostics

• The visitor (DivisionBRVisitor) inspects the diagnostic path:  
  – It checks each node to locate the division operation and its RHS value.  
  – If it finds that the same divisor symbol (and stack frame) is used, it “satisfies” the visitor and attaches a message (such as "Division with compared value made here") to the diagnostic path.  
This extra note helps the user understand exactly where the problematic division occurred.

------------------------------------------------------------
In summary, the checker:

1. Records each divisor (used in division operations) that is not proven to be zero.
2. Later, when a branch condition compares a value against zero, it checks if that value was previously recorded.
3. If so, a diagnostic report is issued (with an attached visitor showing the original division site), and the state is cleaned up when the function ends.

This simple, step‐by‐step plan should help you implement (or understand) the TestAfterDivZeroChecker and guide you through writing a correct and minimal checker.
