Your plan for detecting misuse of errno in this checker can be broken down into a few concrete steps. In each step we track the state of errno, detect when it is being read or written in an unsafe manner, and then generate an appropriate bug report. Here's a straightforward plan with concrete guidance:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Setup and Procurement of Errno Information:
   • Retrieve the unique memory location of errno using a helper (getErrnoLoc).  
     – This gives you the MemRegion corresponding to errno when available.
   • Query the current errno state from the ProgramState (using getErrnoState), which represents whether errno must be checked, should not be read, or is irrelevant.

2. Handle Memory Location Access – checkLocation Callback:
   • In the checkLocation method, first check if the current location being read or written is that of errno by comparing the supplied location (Loc) with the errno location.
   • For a load (IsLoad == true):
       – If errno’s state is MustNotBeChecked, then errno’s value might be undefined.
           • Use the helper isInCondition to see if the errno read occurs inside a conditional expression (like in an if or while).  
           • If the conditions require that reading errno is disallowed (for example, when AllowErrnoReadOutsideConditions is false or if the read is indeed in a condition), generate a bug report with BT_InvalidErrnoRead.
       – If the state is MustBeChecked, then assume that the read constitutes a check and reset the errno state to Irrelevant (using setErrnoStateIrrelevant) and add the new state transition.
   • For a store (writing to errno):
       – If the state is MustBeChecked (meaning errno should have been checked before a write), then generate a bug report (using generateErrnoNotCheckedBug) signaling that errno was not checked.
       – Otherwise, if errno is being updated while it is in the MustNotBeChecked state, reset the errno state to Irrelevant and add the state transition.

3. Pre-Call Analysis – checkPreCall Callback:
   • Before any call is made, examine the called function (using Call.getDecl()).
   • If the function is an external/system function (and its declaration is in a system header) and it is not errno itself (or an allowed function), then assume that it may change errno.
   • If the errno state is still MustBeChecked at that moment (i.e., errno wasn’t confirmed to be read beforehand), generate a bug report using generateErrnoNotCheckedBug.
       – The bug report message should mention that “Value of 'errno' was not checked” and include the name of the function that may overwrite errno.

4. Handle Errno State When Memory is Invalidated – checkRegionChanges Callback:
   • When regions change (for example, due to a function call invalidating memory), check if the region corresponding to errno or its memory space is affected.
   • If errno’s region is present in the list of invalidated regions, update the state by clearing it (using clearErrnoState) so that subsequent operations can start with a fresh state.

5. Determine Context Through Branch Conditions – isInCondition:
   • Use the provided isInCondition helper to examine the AST parents of the statement (or expression) being evaluated.
   • This helper walks up the parent chain to decide whether the current expression is part of a conditional test (if, while, etc.).
   • This check is critical to decide whether the read of errno is “safe” (i.e., in the right context) or if it could be reading an undefined value.

6. Bug Reporting:
   • In both checkLocation (for loads and stores) and checkPreCall, when the conditions indicate misuse of errno, create an exploded node via generateErrorNode (or NonFatalErrorNode).
   • Then, use PathSensitiveBugReport with the appropriate BugType (BT_InvalidErrnoRead or BT_ErrnoNotChecked) and a descriptive message.
   • Include relevant details such as the ErrnoRegion or the source range causing the issue, so the diagnostic is concrete for the user.

------------------------------------------------------------
By following these steps, you can track errno’s state throughout a program’s execution and report errors when errno is misused (either read when its value might be undefined or overwritten without prior checking). Each concrete step matches a callback or helper in the code, making it straightforward to implement the analyzer checker in stages.
