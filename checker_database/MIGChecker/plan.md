Your checker follows a simple plan that can be broken down into a few concrete steps. Here’s how you can think of the detection strategy and then implement it step by step:

--------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

Step 1. Identify a MIG Routine
• Check if you are currently inside a function that follows the MIG calling convention.  
  – Use the helper isInMIGCall(CheckerContext &C) to determine if the current routine is a MIG callback (by checking the routine’s attributes and its class hierarchy).  
  – This is important because the checker only applies to MIG callbacks.

Step 2. Track Deallocation Events
• Create a Deallocators vector listing functions that “consume” parameters (like vm_deallocate, mach_vm_deallocate, etc.).  
  – For each deallocator, store its CallDescription and the index of the argument that is deallocated.
• In checkPostCall, when a deallocator call is intercepted:
  – Look up the deallocator in the vector.  
  – Retrieve the argument (by index) and use getOriginParam() to map that SVal back to the original parameter passed to the MIG routine.
  – If the parameter is valid and not exempt (i.e. it is not reference counted, as tracked in RefCountedParameters), update the program state to mark that a parameter has been released (using a ReleasedParameter flag).

Step 3. Handle Reference-Counted Arguments
• In checkPostCall, also watch for calls like os_ref_retain.
  – When os_ref_retain is detected, use getOriginParam() to retrieve the relevant parameter and add it to the RefCountedParameters set.  
  – This will suppress the check later for those parameters.

Step 4. Check the Function’s Return Value
• In both checkPreStmt (on return statements) and checkEndFunction:
  – Only proceed if the function is in the top frame and is indeed a MIG callback.
  – Retrieve the function’s return value (SVal) and use a helper (mayBeSuccess) to decide if the returned error code represents success.
  – If the return value is an error and the ReleasedParameter flag is set (i.e. one of the routine’s parameters was deallocated earlier) then we have a potential use‑after‑free.
  – In that case, generate an ExplodedNode and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with a clear message stating that the MIG callback returns an error even though it already deallocated an argument, leading to a double free by the caller.

Step 5. Emit the Report
• Finally, when generating the bug report, include a source-range (e.g. from the return statement) and a descriptive message:
  “MIG callback fails with error after deallocating argument value. This is a use‐after‐free vulnerability because the caller will try to deallocate it again.”

--------------------------------------------------
By following these steps:
1. You “mark” parameters as released when you see calls to known deallocator functions.
2. You “skip” such warning if reference counting (os_ref_retain) is performed.
3. At function return, if the returned value indicates failure and a parameter has been released, you warn the user.
This step‐by‐step approach makes the checker straightforward to implement and ensures that you follow the MIG calling convention violations accurately.

Each step is concrete:
– Step 1 identifies the context.
– Step 2 gathers deallocation events.
– Step 3 handles exceptions.
– Step 4 performs the final checking.
– Step 5 reports an error.

Following this plan will allow you to write a correct checker for detecting use‑after‑free vulnerabilities in MIG callbacks with minimal and clear steps.
