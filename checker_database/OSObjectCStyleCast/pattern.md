## Bug Pattern

Using a C-style cast on an OSObject-derived instance instead of using safer, explicit casting mechanisms (e.g., OSRequiredCast or OSDynamicCast). This pattern occurs when an OSObject (or any object derived from OSMetaClassBase/OSObject) is cast using an implicit C-style cast, bypassing proper type checking, which may lead to type confusion and potential security issues.
