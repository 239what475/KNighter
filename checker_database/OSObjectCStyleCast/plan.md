Your checker uses an AST matcher to search for risky C-style casts of OSObjects. The overall detection plan is relatively short and direct. Here’s the plan in a few simple yet concrete steps:

Your plan here
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Register an AST-based checker:
   • The checker implements the checkASTCodeBody callback. This lets you run AST matchers against each function body.

2. Build matchers to identify problematic cast expressions:
   • Define matchers that look for a C-style cast (cStyleCastExpr) whose target type is a pointer to an OSObject-derived class.
   • Use a helper matcher (hasTypePointingTo) to ensure that the cast’s underlying type points to an OS object (i.e. one that derives from OSMetaClassBase or OSObject).
   • Also bind the record declaration (the destination OS object class) and the cast expression itself (bound as WarnRecordDecl and WarnAtNode respectively).

3. Exclude safe patterns:
   • In the matcher, filter out casts occurring in contexts that already use safe casting functions. For example, if the source expression is part of a call to safeMetaCast or part of an allocClassWithName pattern (which includes a string literal matching the record’s type), then do not report a warning.
   • Use “unless(anyOf(...))” in the matcher to ignore these safe cases.

4. Run the matcher on the AST:
   • In checkASTCodeBody, retrieve the function’s body and run the matcher against it.
   • The matcher visits all descendant statements and collects any C-style cast expression that matches the risky pattern defined.

5. Emit a warning:
   • For every match, call a helper (emitDiagnostics) that extracts the cast expression and the bound OSObject type.
   • Generate a diagnostic that explains: “C-style cast of an OSObject is prone to type confusion attacks; use 'OSRequiredCast' if the object is definitely of that type, or 'OSDynamicCast' followed by a null check if unsure.”
   • Use the source range and location from the matched cast expression for reporting.

By following these steps, the checker reliably identifies dangerous casts and avoids false positives by filtering out safe casting patterns.
