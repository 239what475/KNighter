## Bug Pattern

When operations modify the contents or structure of a container (for example, via clear, push_back, pop_back, insert, erase, or assignment), any previously obtained iterator positions may become invalid. If the program continues to use these stale iterators without properly revalidating or updating them to reflect the containerâ€™s new state, it can lead to undefined behavior. This pattern occurs when modifications to a container are not matched with corresponding updates to all dependent iterator values, resulting in potential iterator misuse.
