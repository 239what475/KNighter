Your plan is to “simulate” container behavior by intercepting calls that change a container’s structure (for example, when elements are added or removed) and then update the analyzer’s program state to record iterator positions and container “data.” In other words, the checker “models” STL containers by tracking both the container’s beginning and end (and sometimes all iterators) so that later operations (or liveness checks) see if an iterator is invalid or out‐of‐date.

Below is a step‐by‐step plan with concrete guidance:

--------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Identify Container Operations via Call Events
   • In the checkPostCall callback, first check that the called function is a member function (or operator) that affects the container.
   • Use a CallDescriptionMap keyed on function names and argument counts. For example, have maps for functions with no iterator parameter (clear, assign, push_back, pop_back, etc.), one iterator parameter functions (insert, erase, erase_after), and two iterator parameter functions (erase overloads).
   • Also check for overloaded operator= and begin()/end() calls.

2. Dispatch to Specific Handlers
   • When a function call matches a pattern in the maps or is detected as a begin/end call (using helper isBeginCall/isEndCall), dispatch to a handler function:
     – For example, if it’s an assignment call (operator=), call handleAssignment.
     – If it’s a begin call, call handleBegin.
     – If it’s a push_back call, call handlePushBack, etc.
   • Each handler is responsible for modifying the current program state accordingly.

3. Modeling Container State in the Program State
   • In your handlers, first obtain the container’s region (using getAsRegion() and then getMostDerivedObjectRegion()).
   • If the container does not yet have associated iterator symbols, create them:
       – For a begin call, use createContainerBegin to conjure a “begin” symbol and store it in a container state map.
       – Similarly, for an end call, use createContainerEnd.
   • Use setContainerData to update the container’s metadata (for example, storing the begin/end iterator symbols).
   • When a modifying operation occurs (for example, clear or push_back), update the state with new iterator positions by invalidating the old ones or by reassigning iterator positions using functions such as invalidateAllIteratorPositions, reassignAllIteratorPositions, etc.

4. Invalidate or Reassign Iterators Appropriately
   • In handlers such as handleAssignment, handlePushBack, handlePopBack, etc., decide whether the operation invalidates all iterators or only a part of them.
   • For example, vector-like containers require invalidation of iterators past the “end” iterator (use invalidateIteratorPositions with a comparison opcode like BO_GE), whereas list-like containers might only invalidate the iterator that was erased.
   • Make your state modifications concrete by calling the appropriate helper (e.g., update the ContainerMap, then call addTransition to store the new state).

5. Maintain Liveness of Container Symbols
   • In checkLiveSymbols, iterate over the stored ContainerMap. Mark the stored “begin” and “end” symbols as live so they are not removed by the solver.
   • In checkDeadSymbols, inspect the ContainerMap to remove container data for regions that are dead and that no longer have live iterators (using hasLiveIterators).

6. Optional: Print State for Debugging
   • Implement printState by iterating over the ContainerMap and dumping the container’s region and its associated begin/end symbols. This step helps verify that your state updates are occurring as expected.

--------------------------------------------------

Each step is fairly concrete: you (a) intercept the container operations in checkPostCall, (b) dispatch the call to a specific handler based on function name and signature, and (c) update the analyzer program state by creating or modifying container metadata (begin/end iterator symbols and iterator positions). Finally, you (d) ensure your state integrations persist by marking live symbols and cleaning dead ones.

Follow these concrete steps when writing the new checker so that each container-modifying operation is modeled in a simple, understandable way that later permits analysis of iterator invalidation and container misuse.
