## Bug Pattern

Passing a null pointer as the first argument to the std::basic_string constructor that expects a non-null C-string, which will later be dereferenced. This pattern occurs when code invokes the string constructor overload that takes (const char*, Allocator) without first ensuring that the const char* argument is non-null, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.
