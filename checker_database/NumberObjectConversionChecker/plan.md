Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Set Up AST Matchers

• In the checkASTCodeBody callback, you construct several AST matchers that look for expressions where a pointer–representing an NSNumber, OSNumber, OSBoolean, or NSNumber-like object–is converted to a primitive (or scalar) number.  
• You define separate matchers for Objective-C number objects (using objcObjectPointerType), C number objects (using elaborated types that match CFNumberRef/CFBooleanRef), and C++ objects (e.g., OSNumber and OSBoolean).  
• In addition, you create matchers that recognize the target scalar types (booleans and integers) so that you can detect when the conversion produces unintended values.  
• Finally, you group these matchers in a final matcher (named “FinalM”) that combines cases including assignment conversions, comparison operators, conditional expressions, explicit casts, and other idioms that perform the suspicious conversion.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Traverse the AST and Run the Callback

• You add the matcher “FinalM” as a descendant matcher over the body of the declaration using a MatchFinder.  
• For each match, the provided Callback’s run method will be invoked. The matching node is bound with labels such as "c_object", "cpp_object", "objc_object", "conv", "comparison", and even a “pedantic” flag.  
• The callback first checks if the match was generated because of a pedantic conversion. With the Pedantic option turned off and if the node “pedantic” is present, the check will simply return without reporting.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Analyze the Matched Node in the Callback

• Within the Callback’s run method, determine the nature of the conversion by checking which node was bound (C object, C++ object, or Objective-C object).  
• Retrieve auxiliary information like target scalar type (e.g., integer, BOOL, or bool).  
• Remove extra qualifiers such as ARC context or const so that the final converted type is clear.  
• Based on whether the match comes from a comparison (e.g. pointer compared to zero) or a direct conversion, decide on the wording of the warning.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4. Generate a Warning with a Suggestion

• Construct a message string that explains the detected conversion from a pointer (for instance, an NSNumber or OSNumber) to a primitive value.  
• The message text should mention that instead of directly converting the pointer to a scalar value, the user should call a dedicated API. For example, for Objective-C the suggestion might include “-boolValue” (or “nil” comparison in pedantic cases), whereas for C++ the proper call could be “getValue()” or “CFNumberGetValue()”.  
• Optionally, if the match was based on a pedantic conversion, augment the message with additional suggestion detail.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5. Report the Bug

• Finally, use the BugReporter’s EmitBasicReport function and provide the constructed message, the kind of diagnostic (e.g., “Suspicious number object conversion”), and the source location (obtained from the matched object’s source range).  
• The report is then emitted so that the user sees a warning about the potential logic error in converting an object pointer directly to a number.

------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of the Flow

1. In checkASTCodeBody, set up a composite matcher (“FinalM”) that captures every suspicious conversion pattern involving number objects.  
2. Traverse the AST with the MatchFinder and invoke the Callback for each match.  
3. The Callback examines if the matched conversion is allowed or if it is pedantic (skipping if Pedantic is disabled and the conversion is trivial).  
4. Compose an error message that explains the conversion issue and suggests a proper API call for obtaining a scalar value.  
5. Report the issue using the BugReporter with the appropriate diagnostic category and source location.

------------------------------------------------------------
By following these steps, you ensure that the NumberObjectConversionChecker detects and warns about unexpected conversions of pointer objects to number values, prompting the developer to use the proper API calls instead.
