Your plan should break down how the checker “GenericTaintChecker” uses taint configuration rules, propagates taint across calls, and finally reports errors when untrusted data reaches sensitive sinks. Here’s a concrete, step‐by‐step guide:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here
------------------------------------------------------------
1. • Initialize and Set Up Taint Rules  
   – In the checkPreCall callback, call initTaintRules(C) to lazily build two sets of rules:  
  ○ A static map (StaticTaintRules) that lists built-in function names (for common C functions, e.g. fopen, gets, memcpy, etc.) and assigns them a taint “role” (source, sink, or propagator).  
  ○ A dynamic map (DynamicTaintRules) loaded from an external YAML configuration if provided.  
   – These call description maps use GenericTaintRule objects that come with a set of argument indexes (stored in an ArgSet) for the role they play.

2. • Process Pre‐Call Events (checkPreCall)  
   – When a function call is intercepted, determine if the call is a “global C function.”  
   – Lookup the call in the StaticTaintRules or DynamicTaintRules maps. If a rule is found, call its process() method.  
   – In process(), for each argument (or for the return value when using index –1):  
  ○ For “Sink” rules: if the argument (or the data it points to) is tainted, immediately report an error using a diagnostic message (e.g. “Untrusted data is passed to a system call”).  
  ○ For “Filter” rules: remove the taint from the given argument(s).  
  ○ For “Propagation” rules: inspect the argument set designated as a taint source. If any such argument is tainted, mark the destination arguments (and possibly the return value) to be tainted by recording their indexes in a program state map (TaintArgsOnPostVisit) keyed to the current stack frame.
   – Additionally, perform extra checks such as:  
  ○ Examining format-string arguments in functions like printf (by calling getPrintfFormatArgumentNum) and reporting an error if the format string or its pointer is tainted.  
  ○ Handling socket-related calls: if socket() is called with a protocol name outside a safe set, mark the return value for post-call tainting.

3. • Process Post‐Call Events (checkPostCall)  
   – After the call returns, in checkPostCall the checker retrieves TaintArgsOnPostVisit from the state for the current stack frame.  
   – For each recorded argument index (or ReturnValueIndex for the function’s return value), get the associated symbolic value.  
   – Then, call addTaint() on that value so that taint flows “forward” into the result (or the pointed-to memory of an argument).  
   – Finally, remove the TaintArgsOnPostVisit information from state.  
   – Also generate a NoteTag using the taintPropagationExplainerTag to explain to the user how taint was propagated.

4. • Reporting and Diagnostic Emission  
   – When a sink is reached (via process() in a sink rule) or when a dangerous propagation occurs, generate a non-fatal error node and create a PathSensitiveBugReport with an appropriate message (e.g. "Untrusted data is used as a format string" or "Untrusted data is passed to a system call").  
   – Attach ranges (and sometimes extra note tagging) to indicate exactly which argument or return value is tainted and why.

5. • Utility Functions and Taint Helpers  
   – Use helper functions such as:  
  ○ isTaintedOrPointsToTainted(State, ...) to decide whether a given SVal or its pointee is tainted.  
  ○ getTaintedPointeeOrPointer(...) which checks both the pointer and (if available) its pointed data and also treats standard input (stdin) as tainted.  
   – These ensure that taint is tracked correctly through pointer dereferences and function calls.

------------------------------------------------------------
By following these concrete steps you can understand, write, and extend the checker. Each step uses explicit program state manipulations, rule look-up via CallDescriptionMaps, and well‐defined transitions in the analyzer’s state when propagating or removing taint. This approach minimizes the number of steps while ensuring that every detail in the taint propagation, filtering, and reporting is concrete and traceable.
