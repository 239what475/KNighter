Your goal is to verify that in pointer subtraction the two pointers come from the same memory “chunk.” If they don’t—and they are not symbolic pointers—you should report an error. Here’s a simple, step‐by-step plan:

------------------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Filter for Subtraction Operators  
   • In your checkPreStmt callback, first check that the BinaryOperator’s opcode is subtraction (BO_Sub).  
   • If it isn’t, simply return.

2. Retrieve the Pointer Values  
   • Use the CheckerContext to get the SVal (symbolic value) for the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the subtraction.  
   • These values represent your pointers.

3. Convert Values to Memory Regions  
   • Attempt to get the memory region for each SVal by calling getAsRegion().  
   • If either value is not a region (i.e. conversion fails), return without reporting a bug.

4. Get the Base Memory Regions  
   • For each memory region obtained (LR and RR), call getBaseRegion() to get their base. This strips any subscripting information so that you compare the underlying memory chunks.

5. Verify the Regions are the Same  
   • If the two base regions are equal, then the pointers refer to the same memory chunk and no error should be reported.  
   • Otherwise, continue checking.

6. Allow Symbolic Regions (Heuristic)  
   • If either base region is a SymbolicRegion, then the analysis cannot prove they refer to different chunks. In that case, simply return to allow arithmetic on symbolic pointers.

7. Report the Violation  
   • If none of the above conditions are met (i.e. you have two different, concrete base memory regions), generate an ExplodedNode using C.generateNonFatalErrorNode().  
   • Create a bug report with a clear message (for example, “Subtraction of two pointers that do not point to the same memory chunk may cause incorrect result.”).  
   • Add the source range (using B->getSourceRange()) to the bug report so that the user can see where the subtraction happens.  
   • Finally, use C.emitReport() to issue the bug report.

------------------------------------------------------------
This plan covers all key decisions: validating the operator, obtaining pointer values, converting them to memory regions and comparing their bases, handling symbolic regions for flexibility, and finally reporting an error in concrete cases. With these steps, you can write a correct checker that adheres closely to CWE-469 (pointer subtraction issues).
