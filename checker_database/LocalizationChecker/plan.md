Your detection plan can be summarized in the following concrete steps:

------------------------------------------------------------
Plan
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Setup program state for tracking string “localization”:
   • Define a program state map (LocalizedMemMap) that associates a MemRegion to a LocalizedState (either “Localized” or “NonLocalized”).
   • Use this map to record whether a given string value (usually an NSString or a literal) is considered localized.

2. Initialize and record localization information from known API signatures:
   • In the NonLocalizedStringChecker, build a list of UI methods (in initUIMethods) that require their string arguments to be localized.
   • Also initialize a set of functions/methods (via initLocStringsMethods) that are known to return already localized strings.
   • These initializations enable the checker to know which methods need a localized string and which return one.

3. Propagate localization state in message and function calls:
   • In checkPostCall and checkPostObjCMessage:
     – When a function or message returns a string (such as an NSString), check whether it is annotated or belongs to a list of “good” functions.
     – If it is annotated as returning a localized string or comes from a known localized source, call a helper (setLocalizedState) to mark its result as localized.
     – Otherwise, in “aggressive” mode or for non-symbolic string values (for example, string literals), flag it as non-localized using setNonLocalizedState.
   • In checkPreCall:
     – For functions that take a parameter marked with a localized attribute, inspect the actual argument.
     – If the argument’s MemRegion is tracked as non-localized, report a warning via reportLocalizationError.

4. Check objective‑C messages for non‑localized arguments:
   • In checkPreObjCMessage:
     – Determine if the receiver or one of the method’s arguments is expected to be localized.
     – For methods like those on NSString that draw to the screen (or other UI methods from the UIMethods list), retrieve the actual argument value.
     – If the string is flagged as non-localized, report the localization error immediately.
   • Also, inspect selector names and try to match them (by traversing the class hierarchy) to the registered UI methods.

5. Mark string literals appropriately:
   • In checkPostStmt callback for ObjCStringLiterals, mark empty or literal strings as non-localized (using setNonLocalizedState).
   • This helps to later flag cases that use these literals as arguments to UI functions expecting a localized version.

6. Provide a Bug Report visitor to highlight the problematic literal:
   • Use a BugReporterVisitor (NonLocalizedStringBRVisitor) that, when visiting an error node, checks if the the reported MemRegion corresponds to the problematic literal.
   • If so, add a supplemental diagnostic piece (e.g. a highlighted source range) pointing to the string literal.

7. Check macro usage for localization context:
   • In the EmptyLocalizationContextChecker, walk through ObjC implementations (via checkASTDecl).
   • For each method, use a helper “MethodCrawler” to visit every ObjCMessageExpr that calls NSLocalizedString (or its variants).
   • Re-lex the macro call to extract the “comment” parameter from the macro invocation.
   • If the comment field (meant to help translators) is empty or “nil,” then report a warning that a non‑empty context is required.

8. Detect plural misuse:
   • In the PluralMisuseChecker, use a RecursiveASTVisitor (MethodCrawler subclass) to traverse the AST.
   • Look for conditional statements (if statements or conditional operators) where the condition heuristically checks for “singular” versus “plural” (by examining variable names or literal integer comparisons).
   • If, within such a context, you encounter a call (or message) to a localized string function that is likely misusing plurality (for example, if the string is determined by a “LOC” function or NSLocalizedString macro), then generate a diagnostic advising the use of proper plural forms (for instance via .stringsdict files).

9. Register all checkers:
   • Ensure that each checker (NonLocalizedStringChecker, EmptyLocalizationContextChecker, and PluralMisuseChecker) is registered in the checker registration functions.
   • This ensures that when the analyzer is run, it will apply these checks automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------
Each of these steps is concrete and tied directly to a part of the code. This plan lets you follow the flow—from initializing program state, propagating localization information along function calls and message sends, and finally reporting errors if unlocalized strings or misused plurals appear in user-facing UI methods.

By following these steps you can write (or adapt) the checker code based on specific localization conventions and use accurate transitions through program states to guide the analysis and subsequent diagnostic reporting.
