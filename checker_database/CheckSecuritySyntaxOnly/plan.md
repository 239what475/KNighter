Below is one simple, concrete plan outlining how the SecuritySyntaxOnly checker works and how you can write one in a similar fashion:

------------------------------------------------------------
Plan
------------------------------------------------------------
1. [Configure and Register Checks]
   • Define a ChecksFilter structure that contains Boolean flags and name references for each individual security check (for functions like bcmp, bcopy, bzero, gets, getpw, mktemp/mkstemp, strcpy, rand, vfork, floating‑point loop counter, unchecked return, and decodeValueOfObjCType).
   • Use a REGISTER_CHECKER macro so that when your checker is registered, each individual check flag is enabled and linked to a checker name.

2. [AST Traversal Setup]
   • Implement a class (WalkAST) derived from StmtVisitor. This class will visit every AST node in the body of a declaration.
   • In the checker’s main callback (checkASTCodeBody), instantiate WalkAST with the BugReporter, AnalysisDeclContext, and the ChecksFilter.

3. [Visit Call Expressions and Select Appropriate Checks]
   • Within WalkAST::VisitCallExpr, get the callee’s FunctionDecl (if available) and then its identifier name.
   • Remove any builtin prefixes (e.g. “__builtin_”) and use llvm::StringSwitch to select one of several dedicated checking functions. For example:
       - If the function name is “bcmp” then call checkCall_bcmp.
       - If the name is “strcpy” or a similar insecure function then call checkCall_strcpy.
       - Similarly, select other handlers (for bcopy, bzero, gets, etc.).
   • Each checking method will verify both the number and type of function arguments to determine if the call violates security guidelines.

4. [Implement Specific Function Checks]
   • In each checkCall_* function (such as checkCall_bcmp, checkCall_strcpy, etc.):
       - Examine the FunctionDecl’s prototype to confirm that argument count and types are as expected.
       - If the check condition is met (for example, using a prohibited function signature or missing buffer length), issue a report.
       - Use PathDiagnosticLocation to set the diagnostic location and BugReporter.EmitBasicReport to emit a concrete warning message.
   • For the mkstemp-related checks, count the number of ‘X’ characters in the format string literal and warn if fewer than 6 are found.

5. [Handle Loop Counter Checks]
   • Implement WalkAST::VisitForStmt to handle “for” loops.
       - In checkLoopConditionForFloat, inspect the condition and increment expression.
       - Use helper functions (for example, getIncrementedVar) to determine if a floating‑point variable is used as a loop counter.
       - If so, emit a warning that explains how using a floating‑point counter can be insecure.

6. [Check Unchecked Return Values]
   • In VisitCompoundStmt, scan for calls to functions like setuid, setgid, etc.
       - In checkUncheckedReturnValue, verify that the return value of these functions is being checked.
       - If not, generate a relevant report warning that failure to check these return values might lead to security issues.

7. [Objective-C Message Checks]
   • In VisitObjCMessageExpr, similarly use a StringSwitch on the Objective‑C selector.
       - For example, when the message is “decodeValueOfObjCType:at:” call the dedicated check method that warns of possible buffer overflow.
  
8. [Finish and Emit Reports]
   • After processing all nodes, the WalkAST finishes. All encountered diagnostics have been emitted.
   • The SecuritySyntaxChecker is registered with the CheckerManager so that it automatically runs when security checks are desired.

------------------------------------------------------------
That is the plan in simple, concrete steps. By following this outline you can write a checker that first configures its enabled checks, then traverses the AST using a visitor (WalkAST), chooses the real check functions for each insecure call (or pattern), and finally emits clear bug reports.
