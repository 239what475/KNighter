## Bug Pattern

Passing a null pointer as an argument to a function when the corresponding parameter is required to be non-null (either by an explicit 'nonnull' attribute or because it is a reference). This pattern occurs when a functionâ€™s interface promises that a valid, non-null pointer will always be provided, but a null value is passed instead, potentially leading to undefined behavior or crashes when the pointer is dereferenced.
