## Bug Pattern

The checker’s bug pattern is about improper memory management — specifically, the inconsistent or mismatched pairing of allocation and deallocation routines. This pattern occurs when memory is allocated using one system (e.g. malloc, new, or specialized kernel allocation routines) but then later freed or released incorrectly. Examples include freeing memory twice (double free), using a deallocation function that does not correspond to the allocation function (e.g. using free to deallocate memory allocated with new or vice‐versa), freeing memory not allocated on the heap (such as stack memory from alloca), or using a pointer after its memory has been freed (use‐after‐free). At its root, the system fails to accurately track and enforce ownership and proper pairing between memory allocation and deallocation, leading to undefined behavior and potential crashes.
