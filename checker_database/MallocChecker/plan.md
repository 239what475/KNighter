Below is one possible, concrete step‐by‐step plan for how the MallocChecker works, broken down into a few simple steps:

1. Initialization and Modeling of Memory Regions
   • Set up program–state maps (for example, a RegionState map keyed by the allocation’s “symbol”) that hold a “RefState” value representing whether memory is allocated, released, relinquished, escaped, or zero allocated.
   • Register the checker with the CheckerRegistry and initialize bug types for various reports (double free, leak, use–after–free, mismatched deallocation, etc).

2. Modeling Memory Allocation
   • In callbacks for allocation calls (e.g. for malloc, calloc, new, new[] and even kernel–specific functions like kmalloc), intercept the call (via checkPostCall or EvalCall).
   • Create a symbolic heap region for the returned pointer using helper functions (like MallocMemAux). This binds the allocation site (the call’s expression) to a conjured symbol.
   • Initialize the region’s state by storing a RefState showing that the memory has been allocated (or allocated with size zero in special cases).

3. Modeling Memory Deallocation
   • Intercept deallocation calls (free, kfree, delete, delete[] and other custom free functions) in checkPreCall or checkPostCall.
   • Call helper functions such as FreeMemAux to update state:
  – Look up the associated symbolic region (by stripping casts, following base regions).
  – Check that the deallocation “family” matches the allocation family.
  – Detect errors like double free (if the region is already released or relinquished) or free on non–heap regions.
   • Update the region’s state (mark it “released” or “relinquished”) so that later accesses can be caught as use–after–free.

4. Modeling Reallocation
   • In the realloc/reallocf modeling (via checkRealloc and ReallocMemAux), distinguish the call parameters:
  – When the pointer is NULL (and size is nonzero) treat it like a normal allocation.
  – When the size is zero, model this as a free of the pointer.
   • For successful realloc calls, bind a new symbolic region to the return value and record a “realloc pair” so that if the reallocation fails later (i.e. returns NULL) the checker can restore the former allocation state and then later report a use–after–free (or similar error).

5. Handling Pointer Escapes and State Updates
   • When pointers are passed as arguments to functions or stored into other memory regions, use callbacks such as checkBind and checkPointerEscape to update the RegionState:
  – Mark symbols as “escaped” so that if they later are used (for example, via dereference) the checker can warn about use–after–free.
   • For special cases (e.g. const pointer escapes), update with a slightly different rule (using checkConstPointerEscape).

6. Reporting Bugs and Leaks
   • When an error condition is detected (memory already freed, pointer used after deallocation, freeing memory allocated on the stack, mismatching allocation/deallocation functions, or leak detection when dead symbols remain allocated), invoke one of the handler functions (e.g. HandleDoubleFree, HandleUseAfterFree, HandleLeak, etc).
   • Within these handlers, generate a non–fatal error node and create a PathSensitiveBugReport with a concrete diagnostic message (often including a snippet of the original function call or allocation site).
   • Optionally, attach hints such as a call–stack or additional details (e.g. “memory allocated by malloc() should be freed by free()”) to help guide the user.

7. Cleanup and Final State
   • In checkDeadSymbols the checker traverses the RegionState map and removes any symbols that are no longer live.
   • If any live symbols that are still “allocated” remain at function exit, these are reported as potential memory leaks.

Each of these steps works together in the checker:
– The allocation callbacks build up a program state that “remembers” what memory has been allocated.
– The deallocation callbacks update (or check) that state to prevent double frees or mismatches.
– Pointer–escape and state–cleanup callbacks ensure that leaked or misused memory is flagged.
– Finally, a series of helper routines work together with the CheckerContext to perform state transitions and to post diagnostic notes.

This simple, concrete plan reflects how the MallocChecker detects a variety of memory management errors.
