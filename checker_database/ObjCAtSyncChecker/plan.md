Your plan is to intercept the evaluation of an @synchronized statement and then inspect its synchronization expression (the “mutex”) to determine if it is either uninitialized or explicitly nil. Here’s a simple, concrete step‐by‐step plan:

----------------------------------------------------
Your plan here
----------------------------------------------------

1. Identify the Expression to Check
   • In the pre-statement callback (checkPreStmt) you are given an ObjCAtSynchronizedStmt.
   • Retrieve the synchronization expression using S->getSynchExpr().

2. Obtain Its Value via the Analyzer’s SVal API
   • Use C.getSVal(Ex) to evaluate the value of the synchronization expression.
   • This will return an SVal which can represent a concrete, unknown, or undefined value.

3. Check for Uninitialized Values
   • Verify if the returned SVal is of type UndefinedVal.
   • If it is undefined, generate an error node immediately:
     ‣ Create a bug report with the BT_undef bug type.
     ‣ Call bugreporter::trackExpressionValue() to attach the expression.
     ‣ Emit the report via C.emitReport().
   • Return early if an undefined value is found.

4. Check for a Null (nil) Mutex
   • If the SVal is not undefined (and not unknown), check if it might be null.
   • Use the assume() call on the state with V.castAs<DefinedSVal>() to split into two possible states:
     ‣ One state (nullState) where the expression is assumed to be null.
     ‣ One state (notNullState) where it is assumed to be non-null.
   • If the nullState is feasible and the non-null state is not:
     ‣ Generate a nonfatal error node.
     ‣ Create a bug report using the BT_null bug type.
     ‣ Attach the expression’s source range (or tracked expression value) to the report.
     ‣ Emit the report.
   • Note: If the expression could be both null and non-null, favor the non-null state (i.e. ignore the null possibility after reporting).

5. Transition to the Safe (Non-null) State
   • If the evaluated state indicates that the expression is definitely non-null (not nil), add a state transition using C.addTransition(notNullState).
   • This lets analysis continue under the assumption that a valid mutex is used.

----------------------------------------------------
Following these concrete steps ensures that the checker first flags uninitialized mutexes and then flags mutexes that are explicitly null. This is the simplest and most direct approach to detect cases where an @synchronized statement might not perform actual synchronization due to a bad/missing mutex value.
