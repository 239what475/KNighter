Your task is to analyze a checker whose purpose is not to flag a specific bug but rather to document (and illustrate) almost every callback available in the Clang Static Analyzer. In other words, the “CheckerDocumentation” is meant to serve as a reference for checker writers. Below is a concrete, step‐by‐step plan to understand and “detect” using this checker.

--------------------------------------------------
Plan

Step 1. Understand the Checker’s Purpose  
  • The checker (named CheckerDocumentation) is designed primarily for documentation.  
  • It “implements” nearly every callback option (e.g. checkPreCall, checkPostCall, checkLocation, eval::Call, etc.) to show what events a custom checker can handle.  
  • No actual bug-detection logic is present in the callbacks. Most callbacks are either empty or simply forward the passed state.

Step 2. Review the Inheritance and Registration  
  • The class inherits from Checker with a long list of template arguments. These include callbacks for different phases of analysis (pre-/post-statement, pre-/post-call, branch condition, new allocator, location access, binding, dead symbols, beginning/ending functions, etc.).  
  • Since all the callbacks are hooked, a developer can see how each possible “detection point” is integrated into the analyzer flow.  
  • The registration is done via the standard mechanism (inside the namespace clang::ento) so that the checker appears in documentation (doxygen) and in the checker registry.

Step 3. Investigate Each Callback Implementation  
  • checkPreStmt and checkPostStmt:  
    – checkPreStmt for ReturnStmt is empty (does nothing).  
    – checkPostStmt for DeclStmt is defined but has an empty body; this shows how to “hook” a statement event.  
  • Objective-C Message Callbacks:  
    – checkPreObjCMessage, checkPostObjCMessage, and checkObjCMessageNil are defined with empty bodies. They serve as placeholders for when one wants to add logic related to Objective-C message sends.  
  • Call-Related Callbacks:  
    – checkPreCall and checkPostCall are defined but empty. They demonstrate how one can intercept a call event and inspect its arguments or return values.  
  • Branch and Condition Callbacks:  
    – checkBranchCondition is provided (empty) so that one can later add logic to react to branch conditions (such as if/while statements).  
  • Memory Allocation and Location Callbacks:  
    – checkNewAllocator (for C++ new operator) shows where to put custom logic for allocation events.  
    – checkLocation is defined; although its body is empty, it is the hook for memory load/store events.  
  • Binding and Symbol Life-cycle Callbacks:  
    – checkBind shows how to hook when a value is bound to a memory location.  
    – checkDeadSymbols is defined as an empty callback so you can clean up state for dead symbols.  
  • Function Entry/Exit and End-Analysis Callbacks:  
    – checkBeginFunction and checkEndFunction provide entry and exit points for function-level analysis.  
    – checkEndAnalysis and checkEndOfTranslationUnit allow processing after analysis or at translation-unit completion.  
  • Evaluation and Assumption Callbacks:  
    – eval::Call and eval::Assume are provided so that checkers can “simulate” function calls or track assumptions on symbolic values.  
  • Pointer Escape and AST Callbacks:  
    – checkPointerEscape, checkConstPointerEscape, and checkLiveSymbols cover pointer escaping and liveness.  
    – checkASTDecl shows how to traverse the entire AST and act on every declaration.

Step 4. Understand the Overall “Detection” Plan in This Checker  
  • Since the checker is purely instructional documentation, it does not change the state or report any bugs.  
  • Its “detection plan” is to list and stub all potential hook points a checker writer might use.  
  • Each callback is briefly commented with its intended use and behavior.  
  • This checker does not produce any warnings or bug reports (except the checkPostStmt stub that does nothing); its value is in the comprehensive demonstration of available callbacks.

Step 5. Summarize for Checker Writers  
  • For every callback, a checker writer can see where to add the logic that monitors specific events such as function calls, branch conditions, pointer dereferences, binding events, etc.  
  • This example serves as a template or “cheat sheet” for writing a custom checker in the Clang Static Analyzer.  
  • When you write your own checker, you can follow the simple sequence:  
       1. Decide which callback(s) are relevant to your detection scenario (for example, checkPreCall to examine function call arguments).  
       2. Add state changes, analyze conditions or expressions, and then create transitions with C.addTransition(State).  
       3. Report bugs by generating error nodes and using C.emitReport(...), similar to the reporting patterns shown in other checkers (see the earlier examples).

--------------------------------------------------
This plan explains exactly how the checker “detects” (or in this case, documents) the different events during static analysis. It is kept as simple as possible with a clear step-by-step outline so that you can easily follow along and use the pattern to implement your own checkers.
