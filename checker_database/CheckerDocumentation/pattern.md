## Bug Pattern

The checker embodies a “no‐op callback” pattern. It registers a full suite of analyzer callbacks (for pre‑ and post‑statement visits, message sends, function calls, branch conditions, etc.) yet nearly every callback is left empty (or with only trivial state transitions) and does not perform any real analysis or bug detection. This pattern is dangerous if misapplied elsewhere because it gives the illusion of thorough checking while effectively doing nothing—potentially causing bugs to be missed or developers to assume that error conditions are being handled when they are not.
