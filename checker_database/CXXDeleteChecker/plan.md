Your plan should outline the key points at which the checker “hooks” into the deletion process and then examines the region being deleted. In the target checker file you provided (which defines both DeleteWithNonVirtualDtorChecker and CXXArrayDeleteChecker), the detection plan can be broken down as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
Your plan here
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Identify the Delete Expression and Retrieve the Memory Region

 • In the checkPreStmt callback (triggered on a C++ delete expression), obtain the pointer being deleted by evaluating the delete expression’s argument.  
 • Convert this SVal to a MemRegion (if available).  
 • Ensure that this region represents a valid pointer value by checking that it can be cast (via getAs<TypedValueRegion>() for static type information and getAs<SymbolicRegion>() for the dynamic allocation).

2. Differentiate Between Delete and Array Delete

 • Check the overloaded operator kind on the delete expression.  
 • Only continue if the operator is either OO_Delete or OO_Array_Delete. This guarantees that the checker only analyzes valid delete or delete[] operations.

3. Extract Static and Dynamic Type Information

 • Retrieve the static (base) type region from the pointer by obtaining a TypedValueRegion.  
 • Retrieve the dynamic (derived) type region from the base region’s underlying region (using getBaseRegion() with a cast to SymbolicRegion).  
 • These two regions allow you to compare the declared base class type with the actual dynamic (allocated) type.

4. For DeleteWithNonVirtualDtorChecker

 • Get the base class declaration from the TypedValueRegion and the derived class declaration from the SymbolicRegion.  
 • Confirm that both classes have definitions.  
 • Check the base class destructor; if it is virtual then there is no problem.  
 • Make sure that the derived class is actually derived from the base class.  
 • If the base destructor is not virtual and there is a valid inheritance relationship, generate a non-fatal error node.  
 • Create a bug report stating that a polymorphic object (i.e. one with virtual functions) is being deleted via a pointer to a base that lacks a virtual destructor.  
 • Use a custom visitor (PtrCastVisitor) to add notes showing where the conversion from the derived type to base type occurred.

5. For CXXArrayDeleteChecker

 • Similar to the first checker, first extract the base and derived types.  
 • However, ensure that the delete operator is indeed OO_Array_Delete.  
 • In addition to checking the inheritance (the derived class must be derived from the base class), compare the types used for deletion.  
 • Format a detailed diagnostic message showing that deleting an array of objects via a pointer to an unrelated base (or incorrect type) is undefined behavior.  
 • Emit a bug report with a note (using PtrCastVisitor) to indicate the problematic cast in the deletion.

6. Diagnostic Reporting with a Visitor (PtrCastVisitor)

 • Implement a BugReporterVisitor (the PtrCastVisitor class) dedicated to appending extra information on the diagnostic path.  
 • When the bug report is created, mark the base class region as “interesting” and then have the visitor check subsequent cast expressions.  
 • For any cast where the source type (the derived pointer) is converted to a target type (the base pointer), add a note that explains the casting.  
 • This extra information helps users understand why the conversion is unsafe (i.e. because the base type does not have a virtual destructor, or because the wrong type is used for array deletion).

------------------------------------------------------------
By following these concrete steps:
 • You extract the necessary type information from the pointer (both static and dynamic) and verify that the correct “delete” operator is being used.  
 • Then you check whether the base class destructor is virtual or the type conversion is safe.  
 • If not, you generate an error node, issue a detailed PathSensitiveBugReport, and use a visitor to annotate the cast chain that led to the problem.

This simple, step‐by‐step strategy ensures that your checker correctly diagnoses two different but related issues surrounding the improper use of delete (or delete[]) in C++ code.
