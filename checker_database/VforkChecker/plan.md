Your checker’s detection plan can be summarized in the following concrete steps:

 1. State Initialization and Trait Setup  
  • Define the program-state trait (VforkResultRegion) to track the memory region holding the vfork return value. This region indicates where writes are allowed in the child process.  
  • Use two special constants:
   – VFORK_RESULT_INVALID: means “not in a child” (i.e. parent process)  
   – VFORK_RESULT_NONE: means “vfork result not assigned”

 2. Detecting a vfork Call (checkPostCall)  
  • Intercept calls in checkPostCall and first check that you are not already in the child process.  
  • Identify if the called function is vfork by matching its identifier.  
  • When a vfork call is detected, obtain its return value and use symbolic reasoning (via state assumptions) to split execution into two states:
   – Parent state: where the return value is nonzero; leave the state unchanged.  
   – Child state: where the return value is zero; set the VforkResultRegion in child state to the memory region that was assigned vfork’s return value.  
  • Transition both states accordingly.

 3. Restricting Function Calls in the Child (checkPreCall)  
  • In checkPreCall, if the current state is that of the child process (i.e. VforkResultRegion is not VFORK_RESULT_INVALID), check if the function call is on an allowlist.  
  • Maintain a simple allowlist (populated only once) from the vfork manpage (such as _exit, execl, execve, etc.).  
  • If the function is not allowed in the child process, report an error to indicate that this function call is prohibited.

 4. Prohibit Unsafe Memory Writes in the Child (checkBind)  
  • In checkBind, check whether we are in a child process.  
  • Retrieve the memory region (from the Bind’s left-hand side) of the assignment.  
  • Allow the assignment only if the target region is exactly the vfork result region (the allowed writable area).  
  • If any other variable is modified in the child process, report a bug.

 5. Prohibit Returning from the Child (checkPreStmt for ReturnStmt)  
  • In checkPreStmt, before any return statement, if the state is a child process, report the error.  
  • Advise that child processes must call _exit() instead of returning.

 6. Bug Reporting  
  • In all error cases (disallowed function call, unsafe assignment, or improper return), generate an error node using the current state and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with a descriptive message.

Summarized Plan Code Block:

--------------------------------------------------
Your plan here
--------------------------------------------------
1. (Initialization)
   - Define trait VforkResultRegion with two special values (VFORK_RESULT_INVALID, VFORK_RESULT_NONE).
2. (Vfork Detection in checkPostCall)
   - When a call is detected, check if it is a vfork call.
   - Split the state into Parent (nonzero return value) and Child (zero return value).
   - For the child branch, assign the memory region (of the vfork result variable) into the state via VforkResultRegion.
3. (Restrict Function Calls in Child in checkPreCall)
   - Check if in child process by testing VforkResultRegion.
   - Look up the callee’s identifier against an allowlist. If not found, report a bug.
4. (Restrict Writes in Child via checkBind)
   - In child process, validate that any assignment (bind) is done only to the vfork result region.
   - If another region is being modified, report a bug.
5. (Disallow Return in Child in checkPreStmt)
   - If a return statement is encountered in child state, emit an error advising the use of _exit().
6. (Bug Reporting)
   - For violations, generate an error node and emit a bug report with a clear message.
--------------------------------------------------

Following these concrete steps will yield a correct implementation of a vfork usage checker that prevents dangerous operations in the child process after vfork.
