Below is a concrete, step‐by‐step analysis of the CastValueChecker’s detection plan:

1. Identify cast calls using a mapping (CDM):
   • The checker installs a CallDescriptionMap that pairs well‐known cast functions (such as llvm::cast, llvm::dyn_cast, clang::castAs, etc.) with a callback function and a call “kind” (Function, Method, or InstanceOf).  
   • When a call event is received (via evalCall), it is looked up in this map to decide whether the call should be modeled.

2. Extract the operand to be cast:
   • Once a matching cast function is found, the checker extracts the value being cast:
  – For function-like casts (e.g. llvm::cast, llvm::dyn_cast), the first argument is used.
  – For methods (e.g. castAs, getAs), the this-pointer is extracted.
  – For instance-of checks (isa, isa_and_nonnull), the first argument is used, after verifying template arguments.
   • The extracted value (a DefinedOrUnknownSVal) represents the object that will undergo dynamic type evaluation.

3. Call the specific cast evaluation callback:
   • Based on the cast kind and the function called, the respective callback (for example, evalCast, evalDynCast, evalCastOrNull, etc.) is invoked.
   • These callbacks differ in how they treat null versus non-null values. For example, some cast functions ensure that non-null inputs must yield a non-null cast result, while others allow a null result.
   
4. Compute and add a cast transition:
   • The helper function addCastTransition is called to simulate the cast:
  – It first creates a new state by assuming that the incoming operand is non-null or null as required.
  – The checker then obtains dynamic type information (via getDynamicCastInfo) for the operand using its region, the source type (CastFromTy), and the destination type (CastToTy).
   • Based on this dynamic type information, the helper determines whether the cast should succeed. If the assumptions prove the cast infeasible, it generates a sink node (marking an error state).
   • Otherwise, if the cast is feasible (or “checked” to always succeed), it uses setDynamicTypeAndCastInfo to update the program state with the new dynamic type and any cast metadata.
   • The cast value is then re–evaluated (using evalCast on the underlying SValBuilder) and bound to the original call’s expression, thereby letting the analyzer simulate the effect of the cast.

5. Handle instance-of checks:
   • For functions like llvm::isa or llvm::isa_and_nonnull, a corresponding helper (addInstanceOfTransition) is called.
   • This function processes a list of destination types and adds transitions that bind the cast call’s return value to a boolean (true if the cast is deemed to succeed, false otherwise).
   • It uses similar dynamic type checks to decide the transition outcome.

6. Clean up dead cast symbols:
   • Finally, checkDeadSymbols is implemented to purge any cast–related symbols that are no longer live in the analysis state.
   • This avoids stale state entries from interfering with later analysis.

By following these steps, the CastValueChecker simulates custom RTTI casts, models the outcomes of casting operations, and uses state transitions to detect casts that are either infeasible or should return a null value. This plan ensures that the analyzer can propagate dynamic type information along cast boundaries, report inconsistencies (via sink nodes) and attach descriptive note tags to transitions.

----------------------------
Below is a summarized plan in the required format:

Your plan here
---------------
1. Detect cast calls by looking up the incoming call in a predefined mapping (CDM) that associates known cast functions with a callback and kind.
2. Extract the operand being cast:
 • Use the first argument for function calls and instance-of checks.
 • For methods (like castAs, getAs) extract the “this” object.
3. Invoke the appropriate cast evaluation callback (e.g. evalCast, evalDynCast) based on the function name.
4. In the evaluation callbacks, call addCastTransition:
 • Assume the operand is (non-)null as required.
 • Compute dynamic type information comparing the source and destination types.
 • Check if the cast is feasible; if not, generate a sink to mark an error.
 • Bind the evaluated cast (or a null value) to the original call's expression and update the state with cast info.
5. For instance-of cast checks, use addInstanceOfTransition to bind the result to a boolean reflecting whether the cast succeeded.
6. Clean up dead cast symbols in checkDeadSymbols to keep the state current.

Each step is concrete and minimal so that you can directly follow and implement a correct checker.
