## Bug Pattern

The checker’s design exposes a general pattern where the instrumentation or logging of analysis callbacks is used to validate that every expected callback is fired (and only once) during the analysis pass. In other words, if a codebase relies on callbacks being invoked in a precise order and without duplicates or omissions, any deviation (such as missing, repeated, or out‐of-order callback invocations) can lead to misinterpretation of the analysis state. This pattern is characterized by having many callbacks—each with its own enablement condition—whose improper registration or misconfiguration may result in the analyzer either skipping expected checks or processing the same event multiple times.
