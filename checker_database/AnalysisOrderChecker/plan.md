Your checker is not detecting any bugs per se—it’s a diagnostic tool that simply prints messages whenever different analysis callbacks are fired. Its “detection” plan is to trace the order and occurrence of all key callback events during analysis. Here’s a step‐by‐step plan:

--------------------------------------------------
Plan:

1. Decide when to print messages:
   • The checker defines a helper function (isCallbackEnabled) that consults the AnalyzerOptions.
   • It checks for either a “global” option (the "*" option) or an option specific to each callback (e.g. "PreStmtCastExpr", "PreCall", "PostCall", etc.).
   • Only when the specific or global option is enabled does the checker print a message.

2. Instrument specific AST and analysis events:
   • For various statement types (e.g., CastExpr, ArraySubscriptExpr, CXXNewExpr, CXXDeleteExpr, CXXConstructExpr, OffsetOfExpr):
     - In the PreStmt callbacks (e.g., checkPreStmt(const CastExpr*)), print a message indicating the callback type and additional details (for CastExpr, also print the cast kind).
     - Similarly, in the PostStmt callbacks, print a similar message.
   • This mechanism helps trace the processing of these specific AST node types during the analyzer’s traversal.

3. Log function calls:
   • In the evalCall callback:
     - Print a message including the function’s qualified name, the number of arguments, and additional call-kind details.
   • In PreCall and PostCall callbacks:
     - Print a message noting which call is about to execute or has just finished, including the function name (if available) and its call kind.
   • These messages show when function calls are analyzed and help verify that call-related callbacks are in order.

4. Trace end-of-function and end-of-analysis events:
   • In checkEndFunction:
     - Print a message marking the end of a function along with details (for example, whether a ReturnStmt is present).
     - Optionally, print mapping information from the CFG to understand the state at function termination.
   • In checkEndAnalysis:
     - Print a message once analysis is complete.
   • This helps verify that the analyzer cleanly exits from function and overall analysis.

5. Report other callback events:
   • For new allocator events (checkNewAllocator), binding operations (checkBind), pointer escapes (checkPointerEscape), live symbols (checkLiveSymbols), and region changes (checkRegionChanges):
     - Simply check if the callback is enabled and then print a corresponding message.
   • This verifies that even these less frequent events are triggered—and logs their occurrence.

--------------------------------------------------
Using these steps, the AnalysisOrderChecker confirms that every intended analyzer callback is executed once, in the expected order, and without missing or duplicating events. The printed messages provide a straightforward confirmation of the callback order, which is crucial for verifying the internal analysis ordering of the static analyzer.

This plan is simple, direct, and concrete. It helps you focus on printing specific diagnostic messages at each callback event by using the analyzer’s options to enable or disable these messages.
