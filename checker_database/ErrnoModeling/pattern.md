## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern here is the assumption that a well‐known global error state (errno) is stored in a single, identifiable memory region that can be reliably located either by a global variable (named "errno") or by a function (with one of several known names) that returns its address. This pattern relies on using fixed identifier names and system header locations to bind a global side-effect (i.e. changes to errno) to a specific memory region. When programs or environments implement errno differently—such as via thread‐local storage or other nonstandard mechanisms—the model may misrepresent the actual error state. This pattern of “hardcoding” the lookup of a global variable by name and assuming a unique, persistent region for it can lead to mis-modeling similar global state across different parts of the codebase.
