Your checker’s goal is to make the analyzer aware of the system “errno” value by finding its memory region (either a global variable or an artificially created one), binding it in the program state, and then using that region in call evaluations and live-symbol management. Here’s a simple, concrete step‐by‐step detection plan:

--------------------------------------------------
Your plan here

1. Locate the Errno Declaration
   • During the ASTDecl callback (checkASTDecl), search the TranslationUnitDecl for a declaration named “errno.”
   • First, try to find an external VarDecl named “errno” (using getErrnoVar); if found, that is your errno.
   • If no global variable is available, then look for a function (using getErrnoFunc) whose purpose is to return the address of errno.  
   • Store the found declaration (either a variable or a function) in a member (ErrnoDecl) for later use.

2. Set Up the Errno Memory Region at Function Start
   • In checkBeginFunction, first verify you’re in the top function frame.
   • If ErrnoDecl is a variable:
       – Retrieve its associated MemRegion from the state (using State->getRegion) and verify that it is allocated in system space.
       – Save this region in the program state using a trait (ErrnoRegion) so other callbacks can retrieve it.
       – Also, set an initial errno value (here, 0) by using a helper function (setErrnoValue) and flag its state (e.g. “Irrelevant”).
   • Otherwise, if ErrnoDecl corresponds to a function:
       – Create an artificial (conjured) memory region to simulate the errno location.
       – Construct the region using a conjured symbol and then wrap it with a typed sub-region (using getElementRegion).
       – Store this artificial region in ErrnoRegion and set the initial errno value as before.
   • Finally, add the state transition so the analysis state now carries the errno region and value.

3. Model Calls Returning Errno’s Address (evalCall)
   • In evalCall, check if the call matches one of the known errno location functions (using ErrnoLocationCalls).
   • If it does, look up the errno region from the state.
   • Bind the origin expression (the call expression) to a loc::MemRegionVal containing the errno region.
   • Add the modified state as a transition so that any call to these functions returns the address of errno.

4. Keep Errno’s Region Alive (checkLiveSymbols)
   • In checkLiveSymbols, retrieve the errno region from the state.
   • Mark that region as “live” (using the SymbolReaper) so that it is not collected as dead even if it’s not explicitly referenced later.

5. Provide Helper Functions for Errno Value Access and Update
   • Implement helper functions (like getErrnoValue, setErrnoValue) that allow other checkers to read or modify the errno value.
   • These functions operate on the state: binding a new value to the errno region or retrieving the value from that region.
   • They also update a separate trait (ErrnoState) to track whether the errno value has been “checked” or if it still carries a state that must be handled by the analysis.

--------------------------------------------------

Each of these steps is concrete:

• Step 1 uses AST lookup functions and traits to record which declaration (variable or function) represents errno.
• Step 2 leverages checkBeginFunction to set up a persistent memory region in the program state (either directly from a VarDecl or via a conjured region).
• Step 3 intercepts calls to errno location returning functions and “returns” the errno region.
• Step 4 prevents the errno region from being garbage collected.
• Step 5 supplies the infrastructure so that other checkers can later query or update the errno value during analysis.

Follow these steps directly in your checker implementation for a clear, step-by-step approach that integrates errno modeling into the static analyzer’s state.
