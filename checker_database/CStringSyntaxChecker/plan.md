Your plan should be focused and clear. In this checker the goal is to detect misuse of C string API functions by spotting anti‐patterns in the third argument of functions like strncat (as well as in strlcpy/strlcat). Here’s an example of a simple, concrete plan with few steps:

──────────────────────────────
Plan

1. AST Traversal Setup:
   • Define a helper class (WalkAST) that subclasses StmtVisitor.
   • In its constructor, grab the BugReporter, the AnalysisDeclContext, and a pointer to the Checker.
   • This class will recursively visit all statements (using VisitChildren) in the function’s AST.

2. Identify Problematic Call Expressions:
   • In WalkAST::VisitCallExpr, get the direct callee (FunctionDecl) of the call.
   • Use a helper (CheckerContext::isCLibraryFunction) to check if the function is strncat, strlcpy, or strlcat.
   • For each matching function, call a dedicated routine that checks the correctness of the third argument.

3. Detect the Target Pattern for strncat:
   • Write a function containsBadStrncatPattern that returns true if the third argument (length) follows one of these anti‐patterns:
       - A subtraction expression “sizeof(dst) - strlen(dst)” (or a similar variant).
       - “sizeof(dst) - 1” or even just “sizeof(dst)” or “sizeof(src)”.
   • Use helper functions:
       - sameDecl to check if two expressions refer to the same declaration,
       - isSizeof to verify if an expression is a sizeof() call (and that its argument matches the destination pointer),
       - isStrlen to check if an expression is a call to strlen() on the destination.
       - isOne to detect if a literal “1” is used.
   • If the anti-pattern is detected, prepare a message explaining the proper form (using sizeof(dst) - strlen(dst) - 1) or suggest switching to strlcat.

4. Detect Problems for strlcpy/strlcat:
   • Similarly, write a function containsBadStrlcpyStrlcatPattern to check if the third argument may be larger than what the destination buffer can handle.
   • If the third argument is an integer literal (or indirectly initialized) and it is greater than the remaining size of the destination buffer, then flag the issue.
   • Again, use helper functions to extract the name and size of the destination buffer from its declaration type.

5. Report the Bug:
   • When an error pattern is found in either check, retrieve the source location (using PathDiagnosticLocation) from the expression.
   • Construct a diagnostic message (using SmallString and llvm::raw_svector_ostream) that explains the potential buffer overflow or API misuse.
   • Use the BugReporter’s EmitBasicReport function to emit a bug report, supplying the function name, check category (e.g., “C String API”), the message, source location, and relevant source range.

6. Checker Registration:
   • In the Checker class (CStringSyntaxChecker), implement checkASTCodeBody to create and use an instance of WalkAST that starts walking the body of the function.
   • Finally, register this checker with the CheckerManager so that it is run on the AST body of the code.

This plan uses precise and concrete steps so that you can write the checker code step by step. Follow each item and implement the helper functions and visitor methods as described.
