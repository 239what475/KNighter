## Bug Pattern

The checker reports a situation where portions of a function’s control flow graph (CFG) are not reached during analysis—either as “unreachable” blocks or as points where the analyzer “bails out” (sink points) because it has exhausted its work list. This pattern indicates that certain paths in the function are not analyzable (or dead) due to limitations in the CFG exploration. Such unchecked or unreachable CFG regions can hide defects (or lead to false confidence) in the code, as the analysis may miss execution paths that could be problematic.
