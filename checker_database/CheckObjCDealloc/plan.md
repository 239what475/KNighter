Your plan can be broken down into a few concrete steps that mirror how the checker detects errors in –dealloc implementations. Here’s a simple, step‐by‐step plan:

-------------------------------------------------
Plan

1. Initialization and Registration  
   • The checker is registered to run on several events including AST declaration of Objective‑C implementations, method calls (PreObjCMessage and PostObjCMessage), ordinary function calls (PreCall), function beginning (BeginFunction), function end (EndFunction), pointer escapes, and even on early returns (PreStmt on ReturnStmt).  
   • In the ASTDecl callback (checkASTDecl), the checker inspects each ObjC implementation. It looks for synthesized properties that are “retainable” and require that their backing instance variables be released in –dealloc.  
   • If at least one such property is found and the class is missing a –dealloc method, a warning is emitted directly (reporting “Missing -dealloc”) with information on the ivar that must be released.

2. Setting Up the Release Requirements at Function Entry  
   • In checkBeginFunction, if the current method is –dealloc, the checker collects all instance variable symbols (from synthesized retainable properties) that must be released.  
   • It stores these symbols in the program state map (UnreleasedIvarMap) keyed by the instance symbol. This maps the “obligation” (what must be released) for later checking.

3. Tracking Release Operations During –dealloc  
   • In checkPreObjCMessage, before a message is sent, the checker intercepts calls such as –release on instance variables or even mistaken –dealloc messages.  
   • It checks if the receiver of the –release (or if a property is being nil’ed out via a setter) corresponds to one of the stored “release obligations.”  
   • Helper functions (diagnoseExtraRelease and diagnoseMistakenDealloc) ensure that if an instance variable is released incorrectly (for example, an extra release when the property is ‘assign’ or if –dealloc is mistakenly called on the ivar rather than releasing it), a diagnostic message is generated.
   • For setter calls that nil out a property, the getValueReleasedByNillingOut helper extracts a symbol and then the checker “transitions” that symbol out of the release obligation by calling transitionToReleaseValue.

4. Handling Other Release-Like Operations  
   • In checkPreCall, the checker intercepts calls to system functions like _Block_release. If such a call is made, it similarly determines the pointer being released and updates the program state (removes it from the UnreleasedIvarMap) using transitionToReleaseValue.

5. Diagnosing Missing Releases  
   • In checkPostObjCMessage (after sending a message) and checkEndFunction (at the return of –dealloc), the checker examines the UnreleasedIvarMap from the current program state.  
   • Any remaining symbols (instance variables that were not “released” during dealloc) are reported as missing releases (potential memory leaks) using a bug report with the “Missing ivar release (leak)” bug type.
   • Also during early return (checkPreStmt on ReturnStmt), the same diagnosis is performed to catch leaks in non-standard code paths.

6. Refining the Obligations During the Analysis  
   • In evalAssume, when a condition “assumes” that a symbol equals nil (or not), the checker removes that symbol from the required-releases set.  
   • In checkPointerEscape, if a symbol “escapes” (e.g., by being passed as a parameter to some system function), the checker conservatively removes the related release obligation so as not to over-report.

7. Utility Functions for Release Requirement Decisions  
   • The checker includes helper functions (for example, isSynthesizedRetainableProperty, getDeallocReleaseRequirement) that examine the property’s attributes. They decide whether a property’s ivar must be released, must not be directly released, or if the requirement is unknown.
   • Other helper functions (getIvarRegionForIvarSymbol, getInstanceSymbolFromIvarSymbol, findPropertyOnDeallocatingInstance) allow the checker to map a symbol back to its original ivar and instance context for correct matching and reporting.

-------------------------------------------------
Each step is concrete: you first initialize the context and register the checker, then build up a state capturing the “to-be-released” instance variables at the start of –dealloc, track every release operation (or mistaken deallocation) as messages and calls are processed, and finally report any unpaid obligations (i.e. missing releases) at the end of the function. This step-by-step detection plan ensures the checker warns of both missing releases in –dealloc and extra or mistaken releases according to the property attributes.

This simple, concrete plan should help you write and understand the checker correctly.
