Your checker verifies two LLVM-specific coding conventions. Here’s a simple, step‐by‐step breakdown:

Your plan here
─────────────────
1. Detect Temporary std::string Bound to a StringRef
   • Traverse the body of a function (or any code block) to locate declaration statements.
   • In each declaration statement, look for a variable declaration (VarDecl) whose type is a StringRef.
   • Inspect the initializer of such a variable. The checker looks for a very specific pattern:
     – The initializer must be an expression with cleanups (ExprWithCleanups).
     – Then a CXXConstructExpr is used to construct the StringRef.
     – This construction’s argument is an ImplicitCastExpr that leads to another CXXConstructExpr.
     – Finally, the chain reaches a CXXBindTemporaryExpr that produces a std::string.
   • Once this pattern is matched, it identifies that a temporary std::string (with a short lifetime) is being bound to a StringRef.
   • The checker then emits a diagnostic report indicating that “StringRef should not be bound to temporary std::string that it outlives”.

2. Check that AST Nodes Do Not Allocate Heap Memory
   • Examine each complete C++ record definition (CXXRecordDecl) encountered in the AST.
   • First, determine if the class is part of the Clang AST. This is done by checking if the record’s name matches known AST classes (e.g., “Stmt”, “Type”, “Decl”, “Attr”) or if it inherits from a matching base.
   • For classes that are part of the AST, iterate over all the fields.
   • For each field (using an ASTFieldVisitor), check if its type is one that allocates memory. The checker flags types such as std::vector, std::string, and llvm::SmallVector.
   • If a problematic field is found, possibly after following a chain of nested field declarations, the checker constructs a detailed message that includes the name of the AST class and the offending field (or field chain).
   • Emit a report stating that the AST class has a field that causes heap memory allocation, which is against LLVM coding conventions.

3. Checker Registration and Callbacks
   • This checker registers two kinds of callbacks:
     – One with an AST declaration callback (checkASTDecl) that is triggered for every complete CXXRecordDecl. This callback calls the memory allocation check.
     – One with an AST code body callback (checkASTCodeBody) that invokes the logic for scanning function bodies to detect the StringRef temporary binding issue.
   • The registration is done via the standard mechanism so that the checker becomes active when analyzing the LLVM/Clang codebase.

Using this plan, you can easily follow the concrete steps in the source: identify the construction pattern of a temporary std::string bound to a StringRef, traverse class fields to find memory-allocating types, and register the callbacks accordingly. This step-by-step approach is both straightforward and detailed enough to support writing a correct checker.
