Your plan here

1. Identify the Called Builtin Function:
   • In the evalCall callback, obtain the call’s FunctionDecl using Call.getDecl().
   • If no valid declaration is found, simply return false (no state change).
   • Retrieve the built‐in function identifier (BuiltinID) from the FunctionDecl.

2. Use a Switch Statement on Builtin IDs:
   • Switch on FD->getBuiltinID() to distinguish between different builtin functions.
   • For each case, define the modeling behavior specific to that builtin.

3. Handle __builtin_assume:
   • Ensure at least one argument is passed.
   • Check the argument’s value:
     – If the argument is undefined, return true (modeling purity).
     – Otherwise, call the state’s assume method with the defined argument set to true.
   • If the state becomes infeasible (i.e. false), generate a sink node.
   • Add a state transition with the updated program state.

4. Propagate the Value for “Pass-through” Builtins:
   • For builtins like __builtin_unpredictable, __builtin_expect, __builtin_expect_with_probability, __builtin_assume_aligned, __builtin_addressof, and __builtin_function_start:
     – Ensure that there is at least one argument.
     – Retrieve the first argument’s SVal.
     – Bind the call expression’s value (CE) to that SVal, effectively propagating the argument’s value.
     – Add the new state transition.

5. Model Alloca Builtins with Dynamic Extent:
   • For __builtin_alloca and __builtin_alloca_with_align:
     – Create an allocation region using SValBuilder’s getAllocaRegionVal.
     – Retrieve the argument that specifies the allocation size.
     – Convert this size into a DefinedOrUnknownSVal and associate it with the dynamic extent using setDynamicExtent.
     – Bind the call expression to the computed memory region.
     – Add the updated state transition.

6. Evaluate and Bind Constant/Evaluated Result for Size and Constant Check Builtins:
   • For __builtin_dynamic_object_size, __builtin_object_size, and __builtin_constant_p:
     – Evaluate the call expression (CE) as a constant expression using EvaluateAsInt.
     – If evaluation succeeds, adjust the resulting APSInt to match CE’s type.
     – For __builtin_constant_p specifically:
         ▪ If the value remains unknown, default to a concrete value of 0.
     – Bind the call expression to the resulting SVal.
     – Add the new state transition.

7. Finalize the Transition:
   • In every case after handling the builtin-specific behavior, update the program state by binding the computed value or modifying the state.
   • Return true to indicate that the call has been evaluated and modeled, or false if no modeling was applied.

By following these concrete steps, you can write a correct checker that models the behavior of various clang builtins in the Static Analyzer.
