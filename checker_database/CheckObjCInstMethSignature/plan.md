Your plan here

1. Identify the Class Hierarchy  
   • Retrieve the interface (ObjCInterfaceDecl) of the current implementation (ObjCImplementationDecl).  
   • Obtain the superclass (if any) of this interface. If there is no superclass, then there is nothing to check.

2. Build a Map of Derived Instance Methods  
   • Iterate over all instance methods defined in the current implementation.  
   • For each method, use its selector as the key and store the corresponding ObjCMethodDecl in a DenseMap.  
   • Also, maintain a counter for the number of methods you have inserted so you can stop early if there are no remaining candidates.

3. Traverse the Superclass Chain  
   • Starting from the immediate superclass, iterate upward through the chain of superclasses while there are still derived methods to check.  
   • For each superclass, iterate over its instance methods and use the method selector to look up any corresponding derived method from your map.

4. Compare Return Types for Matching Selectors  
   • When a method in the superclass has the same selector as one in the derived (from your map), retrieve both the superclass’s and the derived method’s return types.  
   • Use a helper (AreTypesCompatible) to check whether these return types are compatible.  
   • Note that if the types are pointer types, the checker simply returns true without deep subtyping analysis.

5. Report a Mismatched Signature Issue  
   • If the return types are not compatible, prepare an error message that clearly states the problem by:  
     - Identifying the derived and ancestor classes.  
     - Showing the method name (selector) and the mismatched return types.  
   • Use the source location of the derived method as part of the diagnostics.  
   • Emit the bug report with all necessary details (message, category, and source range).

6. Update the Map  
   • After processing a matching method pair, mark the corresponding entry in the map (for example by setting it to null and decrementing the method counter) so that it is not rechecked in future iterations.

7. Finish When Done  
   • Continue traversing superclasses until the entire chain is processed or all candidates from the derived map have been verified.  
   • The analysis ends when the map of derived methods is empty (i.e., all potential matches have been checked) or when no further superclasses exist.

Each step above is as concrete as possible, enabling you to carefully implement the checker to verify consistent method signatures in Objective‑C class hierarchies.
