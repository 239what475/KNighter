## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern involves the mismanagement of Fuchsia handle lifecycles. Specifically, it arises when a program:

• Acquires a handle (e.g., through a function annotated with acquire_handle) but fails to release it, resulting in a resource leak.
• Releases a handle more than once, leading to a double release.
• Uses a handle after it has been released, causing use-after-release errors.
• Inappropriately releases unowned handles.

In essence, the root cause is failing to correctly track and enforce the valid state transitions (Allocated → Released/ Escaped, etc.) of handle resources, causing improper resource management and potential runtime errors.
